Recently, several reports have identified crucial roles for miRNAs in controlling the production, differentiation, and health of myelinating cells of the mammalian nervous system.  As single miRNAs are often predicted to target up to hundreds of individual transcripts, miRNAs are able to broadly affect the overall protein expression state of the cell.  In this review, we will discuss how individual miRNAs regulate these various processes, and also how miRNA production in general is required for several stages of myelin generation and maintenance.    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (approx. 22 nt) noncoding RNAs that are capable of post-transcriptionally silencing mRNAs that contain sequences complementary to the miRNAs' 7- to 8-bp 'seed' sequence.

We demonstrate that downregulation of mir-21 in glioblastoma-derived cell lines results in increased expression of its target, programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), a known tumor-suppressor gene.  We have previously reported that mir-21 is expressed at higher levels in primary glioblastoma-tissue and glioblastoma-derived cell lines than in normal brain tissue.  Using a glioblastoma xenograft model in immune-deficient nude mice, we observe that glioblastoma-derived cell lines in which mir-21 levels are downregulated or Pdcd4 is over-expressed exhibit decreased tumor formation and growth.  In addition, our data indicate that either downregulation of mir-21 or overexpression of its target, Pdcd4, in glioblastoma-derived cell lines leads to decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased colony formation in soft agar.  Significantly, tumors grow when the glioblastoma-derived cell lines are transfected with anti-mir-21 and siRNA to Pdcd4, confirming that the tumor growth is specifically regulated by Pdcd4.  These critical in vivo findings demonstrate an important functional linkage between mir-21 and Pdcd4 and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the known high level of mir-21 expression in glioblastoma can attribute to tumorigenesis--namely, inhibition of Pdcd4 and its tumor-suppressive functions.

CONCLUSION: : Acute-phase differential expression of plasma miRNAs predicts CNS disease and suggests that CNS damage or predisposition to disease progression begins in the earliest phase of infection.  At least six miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in individuals with severe versus no CNS disease; in an unweighted expression test, they predicted CNS disease.  miRNAs tracked with viral load and platelet count were also predictors of CNS disease.  OBJECTIVE: : Plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) are modulated during disease and are emerging biomarkers; they have not been characterized in HIV infection.  A plasma microRNA signature of acute lentiviral infection:  biomarkers of central nervous system disease.   miRNA expression was compared with levels of cytokines, virus, and plasma platelet count.  METHODS: : Plasma miRNA expression profiles were determined by TaqMan low-density array for six individuals.  DESIGN: : Plasma samples were obtained before inoculation and 10 days after inoculation from SIV-infected macaques.  Using our macaque/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of HIV, we sought to identify a plasma miRNA profile of acute lentiviral infection, evaluate its relationship with known cellular and viral determinants of lentivirus-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, and explore the potential of miRNAs to predict CNS disease.  Several differentially expressed miRNAs correlated with CNS disease-associated cytokines interleukin-6 and CCL2 and included predicted and/or validated regulators of the corresponding mRNAs.  RESULTS: : A 45-miRNA signature of acute infection (differential expression with P < 0.05 after multiple comparison correction) classified plasma as infected or not.  Nineteen individuals were used to validate a disease prediction test.  miRNA results were confirmed by single miRNA-specific assays for 10 macaques. "

Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.  More importantly, both in cultured rat VSMCs in vitro and in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries in vivo, we demonstrate that the noncoding RNA miR-145 is a novel phenotypic marker and a novel phenotypic modulator of VSMCs.  Here we find that miR-145 is selectively expressed in VSMCs of the vascular wall and its expression is significantly downregulated in the vascular walls with neointimal lesion formation and in cultured dedifferentiated VSMCs.  MicroRNA-145, a novel smooth muscle cell phenotypic marker and modulator, controls vascular neointimal lesion formation.   These novel findings may have extensive implications for the diagnosis and therapy of a variety of proliferative vascular diseases.    We have further identified that miR-145-mediated phenotypic modulation of VSMCs is through its target gene KLF5 and its downstream signaling molecule, myocardin.  VSMC differentiation marker genes such as SM alpha-actin, calponin, and SM-MHC are upregulated by premiR-145 or adenovirus expressing miR-145 (Ad-miR-145) but are downregulated by the miR-145 inhibitor 2'OMe-miR-145.

Normal Huntingtin (HTT) and mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) are expressed in multiple tissues and can alter transcription of microRNAs (miRs).  In a cell line over-expressing mHTT-Exon-1, miR microarray analysis was used to identify candidate miRs.  We therefore sought to identify potential miR biomarkers of HD that are present in, and have functional consequences for, neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.  We found that miR-34b is significantly elevated in response to mHTT-Exon-1, and its blockade alters the toxicity of mHTT-Exon-1 in vitro.  We then examined their presence and bio-stability in control and HD plasma.  We also show that miR-34b is detectable in plasma from small input volumes and is insensitive to freeze-thaw-induced RNA degradation.  Interestingly, miR-34b is significantly elevated in plasma from HD gene carriers prior to symptom onset. "

Taken together, our results define developmental microRNA expression signatures that both characterize and contribute to the phenotypic diversity of glioblastoma subclasses, thereby providing an expanded framework for understanding the pathogenesis of glioblastoma in a human neurodevelopmental context.

We also identified several microRNAs as potent regulators of subclass-specific gene expression networks in glioblastoma.

Furthermore, the miR-21 inhibitor significantly enhanced apoptosis in both U251 cells and LN229 cells, and cell invasiveness was obviously weakened.  The data strongly suggested that a regulatory loop between miR-21 and STAT3 might provide an insight into the mechanism of modulating EGFR/STAT3 signaling.  CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the miR-21 inhibitor could enhance the chemo-sensitivity of human glioblastoma cells to taxol.  Thus, the miR-21 inhibitor might interrupt the activity of EGFR pathways, independently of PTEN status.  Meanwhile, the expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 decreased to relatively low levels after miR-21 inhibitor and taxol treatment.  A combination of miR-21 inhibitor and taxol could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling the growth of GBM by inhibiting STAT3 expression and phosphorylation.    Expression of miR-21 was investigated by RT-PCR, and western blotting was performed to evaluate malignancy related protein alteration.  RESULTS: IC(50) values were dramatically decreased in cells treated with miR-21 inhibitor combine with taxol, to a greater extent than those treated with taxol alone.  The mechanism between the miR-21 inhibitor and the anticancer drug taxol was analyzed using the Zheng-Jun Jin method.  Annexin V/PI staining was performed, and apoptosis and the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis.  BACKGROUND: Substantial data indicate that the oncogene microRNA 21 (miR-21) is significantly elevated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and regulates multiple genes associated with cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasiveness.  MicroRNA-21 inhibitor sensitizes human glioblastoma cells U251 (PTEN-mutant) and LN229 (PTEN-wild type) to taxol.   The 50% inhibitory concentration and cell viability were determined by the MTT assay.  METHODS: Human glioblastoma U251 (PTEN-mutant) and LN229 (PTEN wild-type) cells were treated with taxol and the miR-21 inhibitor (in a poly (amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer), alone or in combination.  So far, the effect of downregulating miR-21 to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect to taxol has not been studied in human GBM.  Thus, miR-21 can theoretically become a target to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect in cancer therapy. "

Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-29b with locked nucleic acid increased the production and secretion of hPGRN in NIH3T3 cells.

We investigated the role of miR-21 after stroke in the rat.  In vitro, overexpression of miR-21 in cultured cortical neurons substantially suppressed oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced apoptotic cell death, whereas attenuation of endogenous miR-21 by antisense inhibition exacerbated cell death after oxygen and glucose deprivation.  In situ hybridization revealed that miR-21 expression was upregulated in neurons of the ischemic boundary zone, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that stroke increased mature miR-21 levels by approximately threefold in neurons isolated from the ischemic boundary zone by laser capture microdissection as compared with homologous contralateral neurons 2 days (n = 4; P < 0.05) and 7 days (n = 3; P < 0.05) after stroke.

In contrast, ischemic cell death in females is primarily triggered by mitochondrial cytochrome c release with subsequent caspase activation.  Stroke-induced cell death in males is initiated by the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor, resulting in caspase-independent cell death.  XIAP mRNA levels were higher in females at baseline.  Because X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the primary endogenous inhibitor of caspases, its regulation may play a unique role in the response to injury in females.

Further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that proteasome inhibition, although increased the occupancy of myocardin and SRF on the promoter of SM α-actin gene, abolished myocardin-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II.  We further examined the degradation of myocardin in epithelioid and spindle-shaped SMCs and revealed that myocardin in more differentiated spindle-shaped SMCs was more quickly degraded and had shorter half-life than in epithelioid SMCs.  In neointimal lesions, we found that stabilization of myocardin protein was companied by downregulation of transcripts of ubiquitin and proteasome subunits, further illustrating the mechanism underlying reduction of myocardin transcriptional activity.

METHODS: The survival curves of NG2-KO mice overexpressing PDGF-B were compared to controls by using a Log-rank test.  We have recently generated a glioma model based on the overexpression of PDGF-B in neural progenitors and here we investigated the possible relevance of NG2 during PDGF-driven gliomagenesis.  NG2 has been shown to function as a co-receptor for PDGF ligands whose aberrant expression is common in gliomas.  BACKGROUND: In the last years, the transmembrane proteoglycan NG2 has gained interest as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diverse tumor types, including gliomas, because increases of its expression correlate with dismal prognosis.  PDGF-B-driven gliomagenesis can occur in the absence of the proteoglycan NG2.   On the basis of the data obtained, we therefore suggest that the role of NG2 as a target molecule for glioma treatment should be carefully reconsidered.    CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis, using both NG2-KO mice and a miRNA based silencing approach, clearly demonstrates that NG2 is not required for PDGF-B to efficiently induce and maintain gliomas from neural progenitors.  RESULTS: We showed that the lack of NG2 does not appreciably affect any of the characterized steps of PDGF-driven brain tumorigenesis, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) induction, the recruitment of bystander OPCs and the progression to full malignancy, which take place as in wild type animals.

Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells.  In mammal animals, their function mainly represses the target mRNAs transcripts via imperfectly complementary to the 3'UTR of target mRNAs.  However, resistance develops quickly and with high frequency.  Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma.  Our studies showed that TMZ markedly enhanced apoptosis in U87MG cells compared with untreated cells (P<0.05).  To explore the mechanism of resistance, we found that miR-21 could protect human glioblastoma U87MG cells from TMZ induced apoptosis.  However, over-express miR-21 in U87MG cells could significantly reduce TMZ-induced apoptosis (P<0.05).  Pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are known to regulate the apoptosis of glioma cells.  Further research demonstrated that the mechanism was associated with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and change in caspase-3 activity.  Bax is shown to correlate with an increased survival of glioblastoma multiforme patients.  However, such effect was partly prevented by treatment of cells with miR-21 overexpression before, which appeared to downregulate the Bax expression, upregulate the Bcl-2 expression and decrease caspase-3 activity.  Compared to control cells, cells treated with TMZ showed a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity (P<0.01).  Taken together, these results suggested that over-express miR-21 could inhibit TMZ-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells, at least in part, by decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, which highlighted the possibility of miR-21 overexpression in the clinical resistance to chemotherapeutic therapy of TMZ.

Molecular functions of these miRNAs in gliomagenesis are mainly unknown.

Tau inclusions are a prominent feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease.  Their accumulation in neurons as ubiquitinated filaments suggests a failure in the degradation limb of the Tau pathway.  The cochaperone BAG2 sweeps paired helical filament- insoluble tau from the microtubule.

In this review, we examine the role of these novel ncRNAs in the nervous system and highlight emerging evidence that implicates RNA-based networks in the molecular pathogenesis of stroke.

In addition, we discuss the development of future therapeutic strategies for locus-specific and genome-wide regulation of genes and functional gene networks through the modulation of RNA transcription, posttranscriptional RNA processing (eg, RNA modifications, quality control, intracellular trafficking, and local and long-distance intercellular transport), and RNA translation.

We demonstrated that both human gliomas (regardless of their grade) and methylcholanthrene-induced mouse glioma shared an miRNA expression profile that is reminiscent of NPCs.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a SNP-array based genome-wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines, to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion, which may harbour critical disease genes.

Amplification and overexpression of Hsa-miR-30b, Hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 at 8q24.22-q24.23 in medulloblastoma.   The identification of critical genes involved in its pathogenesis will be central to advances in our understanding of its molecular basis, and the development of improved therapeutic approaches.  BACKGROUND: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood.  Of these, only expression of hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 correlated with copy number status, and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub-sets of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum.  Additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (iFISH), PCR-based mapping and SNP-array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 is independent of MYC amplification at 8q24.21, and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types, suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development.  Detailed mapping identified a 3Mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes (ZFAT1, LOC286094, KHDRBS3) and two genes encoding micro-RNAs (hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d).

        "sentence": "We also found that miR-326 promoted T(H)-17 differentiation by targeting Ets-1, a negative regulator of T(H)-17 differentiation.  Our data show a critical role for microRNA in T(H)-17 differentiation and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.    Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells) are increasingly recognized as key participants in various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.  Although sets of transcription factors and cytokines are known to regulate T(H)-17 differentiation, the role of noncoding RNA is poorly understood.  Here we identify a T(H)-17 cell-associated microRNA, miR-326, whose expression was highly correlated with disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).  In vivo silencing of miR-326 resulted in fewer T(H)-17 cells and mild EAE, and its overexpression led to more T(H)-17 cells and severe EAE.  MicroRNA miR-326 regulates TH-17 differentiation and is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.  "

        "sentence": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors.  Variation in the miRNA-433 binding site of FGF20 confers risk for Parkinson disease by overexpression of alpha-synuclein.   Subsequently, fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) at 8p21.3-22 was identified as a risk factor in several association studies.  We have previously shown linkage of PD to chromosome 8p.  In a sample of 729 nuclear families with 1089 affected and 1165 unaffected individuals, the strongest evidence of association came from rs12720208 in the 3' untranslated region of FGF20.  To identify the risk-conferring polymorphism in FGF20, we performed genetic and functional analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene.  In a cell-based system and in PD brains, this increase in translation of FGF20 is correlated with increased alpha-synuclein expression, which has previously been shown to cause PD through both overexpression and point mutations.  We show in several functional assays that the risk allele for rs12720208 disrupts a binding site for microRNA-433, increasing translation of FGF20 in vitro and in vivo.  We propose this is likely to be a common mechanism of genetic modulation of individual susceptibility to complex disease.    We suggest a novel mechanism of action for PD risk in which the modulation of the susceptibility gene's translation by common variations interfere with the regulation mechanisms of microRNA. "

        "sentence": "The reason why a mild TBI results in varying clinical symptoms is currently unknown.  Based on evidence that microRNA species in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may reflect molecular alterations in neurodegenerative disorders, it can be hypothesized that at early, preclinical phases of the disease, PBMC may provide an ideal and clinically assessable \"window\" into the brain.  Patients who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) from both civilian and military populations exhibit clinical symptoms of varying severity with minimal to profound impact on their daily functioning.  Although most patients make a full recovery, a subgroup of mild TBI patients develop cognitive, somatic, and neurobehavioral sequelae that generally resolve over 3 to 6 months; a smaller subgroup develop persisting symptoms.  Personalized medicine in traumatic brain injury.   Thus, it is conceivable that changes in the expression profile of clinically accessible biological indices (biomarkers), such as microRNA in PBMC, may reflect molecular alterations following TBI that contribute to the onset and progression of TBI phenotypes including chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  It is possible that the availability of TBI biomarkers may provide potential elements with clinical relevance to prevention, prognosis, and treatment of postconcussive disorders.   "
