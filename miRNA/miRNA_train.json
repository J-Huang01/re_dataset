A direct correlation was found between the downregulation of miR-200a and the upregulation of beta-catenin in human meningioma samples.  Thus, miR-200a appears to act as a multifunctional tumor suppressor miRNA in meningiomas through effects on the E-cadherin and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.  miR-200a was found to directly target beta-catenin mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation and blocking Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which is frequently involved in cancer.  Downregulation of miR-200a in meningiomas and arachnoidal cells resulted in increased expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 involved in cell proliferation.  Upregulation of miR-200a decreased the expression of transcription factors ZEB1 and SIP1, with consequent increased expression of E-cadherin, an adhesion protein associated with cell differentiation.  Elevated levels of miR-200a inhibited meningioma cell growth in culture and in a tumor model in vivo.  Meningiomas, one of the most common human brain tumors, are derived from arachnoidal cells associated with brain meninges, are usually benign, and are frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. Here, we define a typical human meningioma microRNA (miRNA) profile and characterize the effects of one downregulated miRNA, miR-200a, on tumor growth.  Downregulated microRNA-200a in meningiomas promotes tumor growth by reducing E-cadherin and activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.  "

MicroRNA (miRNA) expression was assessed in human cerebral cortical gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in order to provide the first insights into the difference between GM and WM miRNA repertoires across a range of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.

A subset of miRNAs that appeared to be strongly expressed according to the microarrays did not appear to be conventional miRNAs according to Northern blot analyses.  Some well-characterized miRNAs were substantially enriched in WM as expected.  However, most of the miRNA expression variability that correlated with the presence of early AD-related pathology was seen in GM.  We confirm that downregulation of a set of miRNAs in GM (including several miR-15/107 genes and miR-29 paralogs) correlated strongly with the density of diffuse amyloid plaques detected in adjacent tissue.  A few miRNAs were differentially expressed in WM, including miR-212 that is downregulated in AD and miR-424 which is upregulated in AD.  The expression of certain miRNAs correlates with other miRNAs across different cases, and particular subsets of miRNAs are coordinately expressed in relation to AD-related pathology. "

Appealing evidence has been accumulating for the involvement of miRNAs in human diseases associated with apoptotic cell death and the potential of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of the diseases.  The importance of miRNAs has steadily gained appreciation and miRNA biology has exploded into a massive swell of interest with enormous range and potential in almost every biological discipline because of their widespread expression and diverse functions in both animals and humans.  It has been established that miRNAs are critical regulators of apoptosis of various cell types.  Tremendous efforts have been made to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in apoptosistic cell death.

Emerging studies have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as possible therapeutic tools for the treatment of glioma, the most aggressive brain tumor.  Pyruvate kinase M2 is a target of the tumor-suppressive microRNA-326 and regulates the survival of glioma cells.   Their important targets in this tumor are not well understood.  We recently found that the Notch pathway is a target of miRNA-326.  Ectopic expression of miRNA-326 in glioma and glioma stem cells induced their apoptosis and reduced their metabolic activity.  Computational target gene prediction revealed pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) as another target of miRNA-326.  PKM2 has recently been shown to play a key role in cancer cell metabolism.  To investigate whether it might be a functionally important target of miR-326, we used RNA interference to knockdown PKM2 expression in glioma cells.  Transfection of the established glioma and glioma stem cells with PKM2 siRNA reduced their growth, cellular invasion, metabolic activity, ATP and glutathione levels, and activated AMP-activated protein kinase.

METHODS: To normalize the GAD67 expression in the striatum after dopamine depletion, we developed several lentiviral vectors that express RNA interference (RNAi) directed against GAD67 mitochondrial RNA.  The vectors were injected into the striatum of hemiparkinsonian rats and the level of GAD67 protein as well as a marker of neuronal activity, mtCO1, was analyzed using western blots.  BACKGROUND: Dopamine depletion of the striatum is one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease.  The loss of dopamine upregulates GAD67 expression in the striatal projection neurons and causes other changes in the activity of the basal ganglia circuit.  Using a lentiviral vectors with a synthetic miRNA scaffold to deliver RNAi, we were able to normalize the GAD67 protein levels in the parkinsonian rat striatum.  In addition, we were able to normalize the increased neural activity, which resulted from the loss of dopamine as measured by the marker mtCO1.  RESULTS: Unilateral lesions of the dopamine neurons in substantia nigra resulted in an increased level of GAD67 protein in the ipsilateral striatum.  Furthermore, we detected significantly higher levels of mtCO1, after dopamine depletion in the striatum.  CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RNAi directed against GAD67 may be a valid approach to correct the dysregulation of the basal ganglia circuit in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.  The possibility to correct for a loss of dopamine using nondopamimetic tools is interesting because it may be more directed towards the casual mechanisms of the motor symptoms.

Transcriptional dysregulation of coding and non-coding genes in cellular models of Huntington's disease.   HD (Huntington's disease) is a late onset heritable neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and death, particularly in the cerebral cortex and medium spiny neurons of the striatum.  This is followed by progressive chorea, dementia and emotional dysfunction, eventually resulting in death.  HD is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the first exon of the HD gene that results in an abnormally elongated polyQ (polyglutamine) tract in its protein product, Htt (Huntingtin).  Wild-type Htt is largely cytoplasmic; however, in HD, proteolytic N-terminal fragments of Htt form insoluble deposits in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, provoking the idea that mutHtt (mutant Htt) causes transcriptional dysfunction.  While a number of specific transcription factors and co-factors have been proposed as mediators of mutHtt toxicity, the causal relationship between these Htt/transcription factor interactions and HD pathology remains unknown.  Previous work has highlighted REST [RE1 (repressor element 1)-silencing transcription factor] as one such transcription factor.  Recent evidence has also shown that REST regulates transcription of regulatory miRNAs (microRNAs), many of which are known to regulate neuronal gene expression and are dysregulated in HD. Thus repression of miRNAs constitutes a second, indirect mechanism by which REST can alter the neuronal transcriptome in HD.  Many of its direct target genes are known or suspected to have a role in HD pathogenesis, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).  REST is a master regulator of neuronal genes, repressing their expression. "

In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults.  METHODS: We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR.  The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples.  The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.  RESULTS: After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples.  Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues.  The down-regulation of hsa-miR-137 in astrocytomas was shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages of this disease.  The use of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-181b and hsa-miR-106a as prognostic indicators of astrocytoma.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a great potential for the use of miRNA profiling as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in defining the signature of astrocytomas and in predicting the post-surgical outcome.    Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. "

The potential biologic significance of this regulation is supported by evidence of an apparent negative feedback loop, with increased expression of three IFN-beta-regulating miRNAs by primate macrophages exposed to recombinant IFN-beta or stimulated to produce IFN-beta.  Thus, miRNAs may contribute significantly to the regulation of IFN-beta in innate immune responses.    IFN-beta production is an inaugural event in the innate immune response to viral infections, with relatively small fold changes in IFN-beta expression resulting in the activation of important antiviral signaling cascades.  In our rapid SIV/macaque model of HIV encephalitis, the virus enters the CNS within 4 d of infection, accompanied by a marked IFN-beta response that wanes as SIV replication is controlled.  The centrality of IFN-beta to the innate antiviral response in the CNS combines with the potential inflammatory damage associated with long-term activation of this pathway to suggest that IFN-beta may be subject to regulatory fine-tuning in addition to well-established transcriptional and message stability mechanisms of regulation.

Consequently, REST translocates to the nucleus, occupies RE1 repressor sequences and decreases neuronal gene expression.  Interestingly, one of these, the bifunctional brain enriched miR-9/miR-9*, targets two components of the REST complex: miR-9 targets REST and miR-9* targets CoREST.  These data provide evidence for a double negative feedback loop between the REST silencing complex and the miRNAs it regulates.   "

MicroRNA expression signature and antisense-mediated depletion reveal an essential role of MicroRNA in vascular neointimal lesion formation.   Western blot analysis demonstrated that PTEN and Bcl-2 were involved in miR-21-mediated cellular effects.  MiR-21-mediated cellular effects were further confirmed in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries.  Depletion of miR-21 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.  In vitro, the expression level of miR-21 in dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells was significantly higher than that in fresh isolated differentiated cells.  Modulating an aberrantly overexpressed miRNA, miR-21, via antisense-mediated depletion (knock-down) had a significant negative effect on neointimal lesion formation.  The aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Using microarray analysis, we demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the vascular walls after balloon injury.

Differential MicroRNA Expression in Experimental Cerebral and Noncerebral Malaria.   To investigate the involvement of let-7i, miR-27a, and miR-150 in CM-resistant mice, we assessed the expression levels in gamma interferon knockout (IFN-γ(-/-)) mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background.  In contrast, no miRNA changes were detected in the heart, an organ with no known pathology during acute malaria.  We identified three miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the brain of PbA-infected CBA mice: let7i, miR-27a, and miR-150.  The differential expression profiles of selected miRNAs (let-7i, miR-27a, miR-150, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-155) were analyzed in mouse brain and heart tissue by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).

Oxygen deprivation, an important cellular stress, revealed MIC-1 as an anoxia responsive gene in glioblastoma cell lines.  The macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) gene was identified as a most prominent p53 target gene upon gene expression profiling.  Furthermore, ectopic expression of MIC-1 in LN-Z308 cell line completely abolished its inherent tumorigenicity in nude mice, while proliferation in vitro was not affected.  MIC-1 up-regulation by anoxia is mediated through an alternative, p53 and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) independent pathway.  Taken together, these data suggest that MIC-1 is an important downstream mediator of p53 function, while acting itself as an intercessor of cellular stress signaling and exerting anti-tumorigenic activities.    In the present experimental model MIC-1 may exert its anti-tumorigenic properties via a paracrine mechanism mediated by host cells in vivo.  Human astrocytic brain tumors select for mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene early in malignant progression.  Anoxia induces macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) in glioblastoma cells independently of p53 and HIF-1.  "

However, modeling gene expression disturbances in schizophrenia in a cell type-specific manner has been extremely challenging.  To more closely mimic these molecular and cellular human post-mortem findings, we generated a transgenic mouse in which we downregulated GAD1 mRNA expression specifically in NPY+ neurons.  This novel, cell type-specific in vivo system for reducing gene expression uses a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the NPY promoter-enhancer elements, the reporter molecule (eGFP) and a modified intron containing a synthetic microRNA (miRNA) targeted to GAD1.

RESULTS: We report here for the first time the involvement of miRNA regulation in brain pathogenesis associated with MCAo.  Comparison with the corresponding DNA microarray data revealed that the target mRNA expression is correlated with the regulation of miRNA.  We have also provided evidence that some of the miRNAs that are highly expressed in the ischemic brain can be detected in blood samples.

Here, I am reviewing main features of this epigenetic phenomenon, its relevance for health and disease, as well as potential prospects for using RNA editing as a therapeutic tool.    Widespread A-to-I modification of repeat sequences in the human transcriptome suggests additional roles for RNA editing and links it to other processes of gene regulation, such as RNA splicing as well as siRNA mediated gene silencing and miRNA function.  The deficiency or misregulation of editing has been implicated in the etiology of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), depression and tumor progression.  Also, it regulates important functional properties of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the central nervous system by changing single codons in pre-mRNA.  A-to-I RNA editing generates transcriptome and proteome diversity allowing organisms to produce many more gene products and functions than predicted based on the number of genes within their genome.

        "sentence": "New insights into the roles of microRNAs in drug addiction and neuroplasticity.   In this review, the aim is to provide an overview of the emerging role of miRNAs in addiction.    miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, particularly abundant in the nervous system, that play key roles as regulatory molecules in processes such as neurogenesis, synapse development and plasticity in the brain.  They also act as key spatiotemporal regulators during dendritic morphogenesis, controlling the expression of hundreds of genes involved in neuroplasticity and in the function of synapses.  Recent studies have identified changes of several specific miRNA expression profiles and polymorphisms affecting the interactions between miRNAs and their targets in various brain disorders, including addiction: miR-16 causes adaptive changes in production of the serotonin transporter; miR-133b is specifically expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and regulates the production of tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter; miR-212 affects production of striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synaptic plasticity upon cocaine.  Clearly, specific miRNAs have emerged as key regulators leading to addiction, and could serve as valuable targets for more efficient therapies.  ABSTRACT : Drug addiction is a major public health issue.  It is typically a multigenetic brain disorder, implying combined changes of expression of several hundred genes.  Psychostimulants (such as cocaine, heroin and amphetamines) induce strong and persistent neuroadaptive changes through a surfeit of gene regulatory mechanisms leading to addiction.  Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, known as the 'reward pathway', plays a crucial role in the development of drug dependence. "

Integrative genomic analysis of medulloblastoma identifies a molecular subgroup that drives poor clinical outcome.

Results Identified are six molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, each with a unique combination of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations that globally influence mRNA and miRNA expression.  CONCLUSION Our results detail the complex genomic heterogeneity of medulloblastomas and identify a previously unrecognized molecular subgroup with poor clinical outcome for which more effective therapeutic strategies should be developed.    PATIENTS AND METHODS We profiled the mRNA transcriptome of 194 medulloblastomas and performed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array and miRNA analysis on 115 and 98 of these, respectively.  To understand the molecular characteristics underlying their heterogeneity and to identify whether such characteristics represent risk factors for patients with this disease, we performed an integrated genomic analysis of a large series of primary tumors.  We additionally validated our findings in three previously published independent medulloblastoma data sets.  Non-negative matrix factorization-based clustering of mRNA expression data was used to identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma; DNA copy number, miRNA profiles, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for each.

The discovery of miRNAs has revolutionized our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression, with the addition of an entirely novel level of regulatory control.  3. One of the most active fields of miRNA research is miRNA regulation of apoptosis, a programmed cell death implicated in many human diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, hypertrophy and heart failure.  Indeed, aberrant miRNA expression has been documented in human disease as well as in animal models, with evidence for a causative role in tumourigenesis.  We now know that miRNAs play pivotal roles in diverse processes, such as development and differentiation, control of cell proliferation and death, stress response and metabolism.  Considerable information on miRNAs has been accumulated in this rapidly evolving research field.  4. The present review provides a comprehensive summary and analysis of the currently available data, focusing on the transcriptional controls, target genes and signalling pathways linking the apoptosis-regulating miRNAs and apoptotic cell death.

Among the AD-related miRNA expression changes, miR-107 was exceptional because miR-107 levels decreased significantly even in patients with the earliest stages of pathology.  In situ hybridization with cross-comparison to neuropathology demonstrated that particular cerebral cortical laminas involved by AD pathology exhibit diminished neuronal miR-107 expression.  We used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from human brain tissue from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center Brain Bank with near-optimal clinicopathological correlation.

Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the deregulated miRNAs are likely to affect target genes present in prominent neuronal pathways known to be disrupted in AD.

Time-course assays of neuronal Abeta treatments show that Abeta is in fact a powerful regulator of miRNA levels as the response of certain mature miRNAs is extremely rapid.  We used sensitive TaqMan low density miRNA arrays (TLDA) on murine primary hippocampal cultures to show that about half of all miRNAs tested were down-regulated in response to Abeta peptides.  Our study dissects the complexity of human AD pathology, and addresses the hypothesis that amyloid-beta (Abeta) itself, a known causative factor of AD, causes neuronal miRNA deregulation, which could contribute to the pathomechanisms of AD.

Sodium bisulfite sequencing of individual adenomas showed that 6 of 30 (20%) that failed to express pituitary tumor apoptosis gene (PTAG) were methylated; however, genetic change as determined by loss of heterozygosity and sequence analysis was not apparent in the remaining tumors that failed to express this gene.  Sodium bisulfite sequencing of pooled tumor cohorts, used in the isolation of this gene, showed that only a proportion of the adenomas within the pools were methylated; however, expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR of individual adenoma irrespective of subtype showed the majority (30 of 38; 79%) failed to express this gene relative to normal pituitary.  Enforced expression of C22orf3 in AtT20 cells had no measurable effects on cell proliferation or viability; however, in response to bromocriptine challenge (10-40 microm) cells expressing this gene showed a significantly augmented apoptotic response as determined by both acridine orange staining and TUNEL labeling.  In those cases where the CpG island of these genes was methylated it was invariably associated with loss of transcript expression.  In addition, in time course experiments, direct measurement of active caspases by fluorochrome-labeled inhibition of caspases, showed an augmented increase (approximately 2.4 fold) in active caspases in response to bromocriptine challenge in cells expressing C22orf3 relative to those harboring an empty vector control.  The apoptotic response to bromocriptine challenge was inhibited in coincubation experiments with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk.

Common variation in the miR-659 binding-site of GRN is a major risk factor for TDP43-positive frontotemporal dementia.   In support of these findings, the neuropathology of homozygous rs5848 T-allele carriers frequently resembled the pathological FTLD-U subtype of GRN mutation carriers.  A significant reduction in GRN protein was observed in homozygous T-allele carriers in vivo, through biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, mimicking the effect of heterozygous loss-of-function GRN mutations.  We further demonstrate that miR-659 can regulate GRN expression in vitro, with miR-659 binding more efficiently to the high risk T-allele of rs5848 resulting in augmented translational inhibition of GRN.  In a series of pathologically confirmed FTLD-U patients without GRN mutations, we show that carriers homozygous for the T-allele of rs5848 have a 3.2-fold increased risk to develop FTLD-U compared with homozygous C-allele carriers (95% CI: 1.50-6.73).  Translational regulation by miRNAs may represent a common mechanism underlying complex neurodegenerative disorders.    We suggest that the expression of GRN is regulated by miRNAs and that common genetic variability in a miRNA binding-site can significantly increase the risk for FTLD-U. "

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs approximately 22 nt long that modulate gene expression in animals and plants.  Co-expression of host and viral microRNAs in porcine dendritic cells infected by the pseudorabies virus.   Almost 95% of reads mapped to the draft pig genome sequence and pig miRNAs previously annotated in dedicated databases were detected by sequence alignment.  An average of 2 million reads per sample with a size of 21-24 nucleotides was obtained from six libraries representing three biological replicates of infected and mock-infected DCs.  A catalogue of porcine and viral miRNAs, expressed eight hours post-infection, was established by deep sequencing.  The present study focussed on the interactions between porcine dendritic cells (DCs) and the Pseudorabies virus (PRV), an alpha-herpesvirus causing Aujeszky's disease in pigs.  In silico prediction allowed the identification of unknown porcine as well as of five miRNAs transcribed by the Large Latency Transcript (LLT) of PRV.  The gene target prediction of the viral miRNAs and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed pig miRNAs were conducted to contextualize the identified small RNA molecules and functionally characterize their involvement in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.  The results support a role for PRV miRNAs in the maintenance of the host cell latency state through the down-regulation of immediate-early viral genes which is similar to other herpesviruses.  The differentially expressed swine miRNAs identified a unique network of target genes with highly significant functions in the development and function of the nervous system and in infectious mechanisms, suggesting that the modulation of both host and viral miRNAs is necessary for the establishment of PRV latency.

Recent evidence suggests that bystander effect may be epigenetic in nature; however, characterization of epigenetic mechanisms involved in bystander effect generation and its long-term persistence has yet to be defined.  Bystander effect occurs when irradiated cells communicate damage to nearby, non-irradiated 'bystander' cells, ultimately contributing to genome destabilization in the non-exposed cells.  We found that localized cranial radiation exposure led to the induction of bystander effect in lead-shielded, distant spleen tissue.  To investigate the possibility that localized X-ray irradiation induces persistent bystander effects in distant tissue, we monitored the induction of epigenetic changes (i.e. alterations in DNA methylation, histone methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression) in the rat spleen tissue 24 h and 7 months after localized cranial exposure to 20 Gy of X-rays.  Further, irradiation significantly altered expression of miR-194, a miRNA putatively targeting both DNA methyltransferase-3a and MeCP2.  Specifically, this exposure caused the profound epigenetic dysregulation in the bystander spleen tissue that manifested as a significant loss of global DNA methylation, alterations in methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposable elements and down-regulation of DNA methyltransferases and methyl-binding protein methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2).

These findings may have implications in the understanding of gliomagenesis, development of targeted therapy and selection of high risk cancer patients for adjuvant therapy.

Muscle coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10) or ubiquinone) deficiency has been identified in more than 20 patients with presumed autosomal-recessive ataxia.  However, mutations in genes required for CoQ(10) biosynthetic pathway have been identified only in patients with infantile-onset multisystemic diseases or isolated nephropathy.  Our SNP-based genome-wide scan in a large consanguineous family revealed a locus for autosomal-recessive ataxia at chromosome 1q41.  The causative mutation is a homozygous splice-site mutation in the aarF-domain-containing kinase 3 gene (ADCK3).  Five additional mutations in ADCK3 were found in three patients with sporadic ataxia, including one known to have CoQ(10) deficiency in muscle.  All of the patients have childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia with slow progression, and three of six have mildly elevated lactate levels.  ADCK3 is a mitochondrial protein homologous to the yeast COQ8 and the bacterial UbiB proteins, which are required for CoQ biosynthesis.  Three out of four patients tested showed a low endogenous pool of CoQ(10) in their fibroblasts or lymphoblasts, and two out of three patients showed impaired ubiquinone synthesis, strongly suggesting that ADCK3 is also involved in CoQ(10) biosynthesis.  The deleterious nature of the three identified missense changes was confirmed by the introduction of them at the corresponding positions of the yeast COQ8 gene. "

However, it was not sufficient for surface protein expression, which was controlled posttranscriptionally via a separate pathway involving the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinases.  Thus, TLR stimulation allows expression of NKG2D ligands through multiple pathways, including downmodulation of specific miRNAs.    In this paper, we clarify that LPS, which ligates TLR-4, preferentially upregulated MICA and not MICB; CL097, which ligates TLR-7/8, upregulated both MICA and MICB; and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, which ligates TLR-3, upregulated neither.  However, NKG2D ligands can also be induced on human macrophages by TLR stimulation, which has been far less studied.  This finding suggests that increased levels of MICA mRNA following LPS stimulation resulted from increased transcription.  To probe how LPS stimulation triggers MICA expression, we determined that the stability of MICA mRNA was much longer than that of MICB mRNA, but neither was changed by LPS stimulation.  Multiple mechanisms downstream of TLR-4 stimulation allow expression of NKG2D ligands to facilitate macrophage/NK cell crosstalk.   This establishes recognition of \"induced self\" as an important strategy for surveillance of infections or tumor transformation.  The activating receptor NKG2D recognizes proteins that are not normally expressed at the surface of most cells but are expressed during a cellular \"stress\" response (e.g., upon induction of the DNA damage pathway).

Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was selectively enhanced in carotid arteries from rats treated with daidzein.  The use of estrogen for protection against vascular dysfunction is limited due to its effects on the reproductive system, particularly in males.  We postulated that daidzein, an isoflavone with estrogen-like effects on the systemic vasculature but not the reproductive system, might enhance nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cerebral vasodilatation.  Male rats were administered vehicle, 17beta-estradiol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), or daidzein (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) daily for 7 days.  Basal and acetylcholine-stimulated NO release was assessed in vitro via carotid arterial rings or in vivo by measuring changes in basilar artery diameter.  Similarly, constrictor responses of the basilar artery to L-NNA in vivo were selectively augmented by approximately 100% by 17beta-estradiol treatment and tended to be approximately 50% greater in daidzein-treated rats.  Effect of short-term phytoestrogen treatment in male rats on nitric oxide-mediated responses of carotid and cerebral arteries: comparison with 17beta-estradiol.   These data suggest that short-term administration of daidzein or 17beta-estradiol modulates cerebral artery reactivity in males by enhancing synthesis and release of endothelium-derived NO. Isoflavone therapy may therefore be a feasible approach to protect against cerebrovascular disease and stroke.    Expression of caveolin-1 was decreased, and calmodulin was increased, in vessels from daidzein- or 17beta-estradiol-treated rats.  eNOS expression was unaffected by the treatments. "

Treatment of stressed HN cells with the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrollidine dithiocarbamate or the resveratrol analog CAY10512 abrogated this response.  Transfection of HN cells using an NF-kappaB-containing pre-miRNA-146a promoter-luciferase reporter construct in stressed HN cells showed significant up-regulation of luciferase activity that paralleled decreases in CFH gene expression.

It is now well-documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity.  We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo.  Finally, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain.  Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology.

Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells.  MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133+) subpopulation of cells.  In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P = 0.001).  Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients.  Here we have investigated medulloblastoma tumors (MBs), which arise from an early impairment of developmental processes in the cerebellum, where Notch signaling is involved in many cell-fate-determining stages.  MBs occur bimodally, with the peak incidence seen between 3-4 years and 8-9 years of age, although it can also occur in adults.  Notch regulates a subset of the MB cells that have stem-cell-like properties and can promote tumor growth.  On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that miRNAs targeting the Notch pathway can regulated these phenomena, and can be used in anti-cancer therapies.  BACKGROUND: Through negative regulation of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) can function in cancers as oncosuppressors, and they can show altered expression in various tumor types.  MicroRNA-199b-5p impairs cancer stem cells through negative regulation of HES1 in medulloblastoma.   To date, this is the first report that expression of a miRNA can deplete the tumor stem cells, indicating an interesting therapeutic approach for the targeting of these cells in brain tumors.    CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MB, one-third of these patients remain incurable and current treatments can significantly damage long-term survivors.  Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.  We further show that in a xenograft model, MB tumor burden can be reduced, indicating the use of miR199b-5p as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, for the improvement of anti-cancer MB therapies and patient quality of life.  Here we show that miR-199b-5p expression correlates with metastasis spread, identifying a new molecular marker for a poor-risk class in patients with MB.  These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations.  Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment.  Upon induction of de-methylation using 5-aza-deoxycytidine, lower miR-199b-5p expression was seen in a panel of MB cell lines, supported an epigenetic mechanism of regulation. "

By combining SNP array-based linkage analysis and targeted resequencing of relevant sequences in the linkage interval with the use of next-generation sequencing technology, we identified a mutation in a gene and have shown its association with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia.  In a Dutch consanguineous family with three affected siblings a homozygous 12.5 Mb region on chromosome 3 was targeted by array-based sequence capture.  Targeted next-generation sequencing of a 12.5 Mb homozygous region reveals ANO10 mutations in patients with autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia.   The analysis of ANO10 by Sanger sequencing revealed three additional mutations: a homozygous mutation (c.1150_1151del [p.Leu384fs]) in a Serbian family and a compound-heterozygous splice-site mutation (c.1476+1G>T) and a frameshift mutation (c.1604del [p.Leu535X]) in a French family.  This illustrates the power of using initial homozygosity mapping with next-generation sequencing technology to identify genes involved in autosomal-recessive diseases.  Prioritization of all detected sequence variants led to four candidate genes, one of which contained a variant with a high base pair conservation score (phyloP score: 5.26).  This variant was a leucine-to-arginine substitution in the DUF 590 domain of a 16K transmembrane protein, a putative calcium-activated chloride channel encoded by anoctamin 10 (ANO10).

At the last follow up, 72% of the patients who had undergone an ATL (mean follow up 6.7 years) and 71% of those who had undergone an SA (mean follow up 4.5 years) were seizure free (Engle Class IA).  Estimated survival in patients in Engel Classes I, IA, and I and II combined did not differ between the two surgical techniques.  Preoperatively, 58% of the patients had verbal memory scores one standard deviation (SD) below the normal mean.  One third of the patients with preoperative scores in the normal range worsened after surgery, although this outcome was not related to the surgical technique.  In contrast, one third of those whose preoperative scores were less than -1 SD experienced improvement after surgery.  Nine (18%) of the 50 patients whose left side had been surgically treated improved their verbal memory scores by more than one SD. Seven (78%) of these nine underwent an SA (p = 0.05).  OBJECT: The aim of this study was to compare seizure and memory outcome in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS) treated using an anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or a selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SA).  Seizure and memory outcome following temporal lobe surgery: selective compared with nonselective approaches for hippocampal sclerosis.

The modulation of microRNAs by type I IFN through the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 in human glioma.   Type I IFNs are involved in double-stranded RNA responses.  The levels of primary miR-21 gene transcripts, precursor miR-21, and mature miR-21 decreased 6 hours after the addition of IFN-beta, indicating that the reduction in miR-21 levels was due to transcriptional suppression.  We did reporter assays to elucidate the IFN-beta-mediated suppression of miR-21; the addition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-expressing vectors induced the IFN-beta-mediated suppression of miR-21, whereas STAT3-inhibiting agents inhibited the miR-21 suppression.  We analyzed the effect of IFN-beta treatment on miR-21 expression in glioma cells and intracranial glioma xenografts.  IFN-beta treatment reduced miR-21 expression in glioma cells markedly, and IFN-beta administration suppressed the growth of glioma-initiating cell-derived intracranial tumors.  Thus, the results of our study show that the downregulation of miR-21 contributes to the antitumor effects of IFN-beta and that miR-21 expression is negatively regulated by STAT3 activation.

Specific microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that support homeostatic gene expression, are significantly altered in abundance in human neurological disorders.  In monocytes, increased expression of an NF-κB-regulated miRNA-146a down-regulates expression of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), an essential component of Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling.  Here we extend those observations to the hippocampus and neocortex of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain and to stressed human astroglial (HAG) cells in primary culture.  In 66 control and AD samples we note a significant up-regulation of miRNA-146a coupled to down-regulation of IRAK-1 and a compensatory up-regulation of IRAK-2.  Using miRNA-146a-, IRAK-1-, or IRAK-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we observe decreases in IRAK-1 and increases in miRNA-146a and IRAK-2 expression in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and amyloid-β-42 (Aβ42) peptide-stressed HAG cells.  NF-κB-mediated transcriptional control of human IRAK-2 was localized to between -119 and +12 bp of the immediate IRAK-2 promoter.  The NF-κB inhibitors curcumin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or CAY10512 abrogated both IRAK-2 and miRNA-146a expression, whereas IRAK-1 was up-regulated.  Incubation of a protected antisense miRNA-146a was found to inhibit miRNA-146a and restore IRAK-1, whereas IRAK-2 remained unaffected.  These data suggest a significantly independent regulation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 in AD and in IL-1β+Aβ42 peptide-stressed HAG cells and that an inducible, NF-κB-sensitive, miRNA-146a-mediated down-regulation of IRAK-1 coupled to an NF-κB-induced up-regulation of IRAK-2 expression drives an extensively sustained inflammatory response.  The combinatorial use of NF-κB inhibitors with miRNA-146a or antisense miRNA-146a may have potential as a bi-pronged therapeutic strategy directed against IRAK-2-driven pathogenic signaling.    The interactive signaling of NF-κB and miRNA-146a further illustrate interplay between inducible transcription factors and pro-inflammatory miRNAs that regulate brain IRAK expression. "

However, little is understood about the roles of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease.  No effect on bcl2 mRNA level was observed.  We show that the expression of miR-34a is inversely correlated with the protein level of bcl2 in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and age-matched controls, and miR-34a expression directly inhibits bcl2 translation in SH-SY5Y cells.  Consistently, miR-34a knockdown through antisense LNA oligonucleotides increased the level of bcl2 protein in SH-SY5Y cells, which was accompanied by a decrease of active caspase-3.  Western blot analysis of active caspase-3 showed higher levels in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 mice and stable transfecant cell line of miR-34a than in controls.

REST and its primary cofactor, CoREST, dynamically recruit highly malleable macromolecular complexes to widely distributed genomic regulatory sequences, including the repressor element-1/neuron restrictive silencer element (RE1/NRSE).  Through epigenetic mechanisms, such as site-specific targeting and higher-order chromatin remodeling, REST and CoREST can mediate cell type- and developmental stage-specific gene repression, gene activation, and long-term gene silencing for protein-coding genes and for several classes of ncRNAs (e.g. microRNAs [miRNAs] and long ncRNAs).  In turn, these ncRNAs have similarly been implicated in the regulation of chromatin architecture and dynamics, transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and RNA editing and trafficking.

To address whether miRNA pathways play a role in neurodegeneration, we tested whether genes critical for miRNA processing modulated toxicity induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to modulate programmed cell death during development.  In parallel genetic screens, we identified the miRNA bantam (ban) as a potent modulator of both polyQ and tau toxicity in flies.  These studies revealed a striking enhancement of polyQ toxicity upon reduction of miRNA processing in Drosophila and human cells.  MicroRNA pathways modulate polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration.   Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion confers dominant toxicity, resulting in neuronal degeneration.  Nine human neurodegenerative diseases are due to expansion of a CAG repeat- encoding glutamine within the open reading frame of the respective genes. "

RESULT: EiF4E3 was the most likely potential targeting protein of microRNA-338.  The potential targeting proteins were then selected according to their secondary structures using RNA structure 4.6 software and their involvement in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury was studied.  Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to testify whether microRNA-338 can recognize the 3'UTR of target protein.  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the interaction between the microRNA-338 and its targeting proteins during the cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.  METHODS: TargetScan was used to predict the targets of microRNA-338.  [Interaction of microRNA-338 and its potential targeting protein eiF4E3].   However, there was no significant difference in the expression of eiF4E3 between these two groups.  The secondary structure of local region of eiF4E3 recognizing microRNA-338 was conservative.  The ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase activity in the experimental group was much higher than that of control group.  CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-338 can recognize the 3'UTR of eiF4E3 while it has no significant effect on the expression of eiF4E3.  The post-target-recognizing regulation for miRNA do exist and this mechanism is possibly related to the tertiary structure of target mRNA.   "

While mice with control implants expressing a scrambled miRNA sequence or sham treated control animals were characterized by KA-induced status epilepticus and subsequent CA3 neuronal cell loss, animals with therapeutic ADK knockdown implants displayed a 35% reduction in seizure duration and 65% reduction in CA3 neuronal cell loss, when analyzed 24 h after KA-injection.  hMSCs with a knockdown of ADK or cells expressing a scrambled control sequence were transplanted into hippocampi of mice 1 week prior to the intraamygdaloid injection of kainic acid (KA).  Following lentiviral transduction of hMSCs with anti-ADK miRNA expression cassettes we demonstrate up to 80% downregulation of ADK and a concentration of 8.5 ng adenosine per ml of medium after incubating 10(5) cells for 8 h.  Here we describe a novel approach based on lentiviral RNAi mediated downregulation of adenosine kinase (ADK), the major adenosine-removing enzyme, in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which would be compatible with autologous cell grafting in patients.  Autologous patient-derived adenosine-releasing cell implants would constitute a major therapeutic advance to avoid both xenotransplantation and immunosuppression.  However, hitherto used therapeutic cells were derived from rodents and thus not suitable for clinical applications.  Cell therapies based on focal delivery of the inhibitory neuromodulator adenosine were previously shown to provide potent seizure suppression in animal models of epilepsy.  Lentiviral RNAi-induced downregulation of adenosine kinase in human mesenchymal stem cell grafts: a novel perspective for seizure control.  "

        "sentence": "The PTEN-regulating microRNA miR-26a is amplified in high-grade glioma and facilitates gliomagenesis in vivo.   Activated oncogenic signaling is central to the development of nearly all forms of cancer, including the most common class of primary brain tumor, glioma.  Research over the last two decades has revealed the particular importance of the Akt pathway, and its molecular antagonist PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), in the process of gliomagenesis.  Recent studies have also demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be responsible for the modulation of cancer-implicated genes in tumors.  Here we report the identification miR-26a as a direct regulator of PTEN expression.  We also show that miR-26a is frequently amplified at the DNA level in human glioma, most often in association with monoallelic PTEN loss.  Finally, we demonstrate that miR-26a-mediated PTEN repression in a murine glioma model both enhances de novo tumor formation and precludes loss of heterozygosity and the PTEN locus.  Our results document a new epigenetic mechanism for PTEN regulation in glioma and further highlight dysregulation of Akt signaling as crucial to the development of these tumors.   "

This study had the purpose to adapt a test based in these experiments in order to check the performance of SOM and the participation of hippocampus into SOM in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS).  Experimental studies have identified pyramidal cells in hippocampus in rats with participation in the spatial orientation memory (SOM), which are named location cells.

The second study has evaluated the participation of hippocampus into SOM in 43 patients (23 with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and 20 submitted to selective amygdala hippocampectomy (SAH)) and 23 healthy volunteers with p<0,05 between MTS and SAH and between controlled and SAH.  It was shown that the test of SOM is suitable to evaluate deficits, but it seems the SOM is not a specific function of human hippocampus.   "

Recent years have seen an intense period of research on the functions of miRNAs, recently discovered key regulators of gene expression that act through suppression of translation of target mRNAs.  Several hundred miRNAs have been identified in humans, and these show characteristic expression patterns, depending on tissue type, cell type or environmental stimuli.  Like other types of cancer, the brain tumor glioblastoma shows a distinct miRNA expression signature, and a number of recent studies have linked these miRNA alterations to key hallmarks of glioblastoma including proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis and stem cell-like behavior.  These studies have opened the door to the possibility of utilizing miRNAs or miRNA antagonists as therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain tumors.   "

RESULTS: Both Pol II and Pol III promoters have been successfully combined with a second expression cassette containing a codon-optimized tetracycline repressor and selectable marker.  We have therefore developed pHUSH, an inducible expression system that allows regulated expression of shRNA, miRNA or cDNA cassettes on a single viral vector.  However, most systems require multiple plasmids that must be independently engineered into the target system, resulting in experimental delay and an increased potential for selection of a cell subpopulation that differs significantly from the parental line.  BACKGROUND: Conditional expression vectors have become a valuable research tool to avoid artefacts that may result from traditional gene expression studies.  These studies demonstrate the broad application potential of pHUSH for conditional genetic engineering in mammalian cells.    CONCLUSION: We have successfully developed and employed a single vector system that enables Doxycycline regulated RNAi or transgene expression in a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems.  We provide examples of how pHUSH has been successfully employed to study the function of target genes in a number of cell types within in vitro and in vivo assays, including conditional gene knockdown in a murine model of brain cancer.

Family history of cancer (with 2 or more cancer cases) was exclusively identified on the parental side segregating the R337H mutation, and 50% (7/14) of them were compatible with Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome.  Cure (>5 years survival free of disease) was observed in 18.1% of the CPC cases with the R337H mutation (2/11), 71.4% of the Pp (5/7), and 25% of CPC cases negative for the R337H mutation (2/8).  All Pp cases (7/7, 100%) were negative for R337H.  We found 63.3% (14/22) of the CPC patients positive for the germline R337H mutation; CPC samples were either heterozygous (n = 7), lost only the wild-type (n = 4), or only the R337H copy (n = 2).  One CPC sample was not available.  The patients, all parents, and some relatives submitted samples for blood DNA analysis.  In addition, we have also examined the presence of the mutation in DNA from paraffin-embedded tumor samples to evaluate loss of heterozygosity.  BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are rare tumors predominantly found in children.  Increased incidence of choroid plexus carcinoma due to the germline TP53 R337H mutation in southern Brazil.   Blood and/or tumor DNA was extracted and analyzed using PCR-RFLP and results were confirmed by sequencing 240 bp of the TP53 exon 10.  Surgical resection was possible in 28 children.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present series included 29 patients that were admitted to the same institution from 1992 to 2010, including 22 children with CPC (0.08-13.6 years of age at diagnosis) and 7 children with papilloma of the choroid plexus (Pp; 0.5-9.8 years of age).  Given the high frequency of the germline R337H mutation in the TP53 gene in southern Brazil, we have evaluated the frequency of the R337H mutation in families with CPC in children. "

Recent studies have identified a molecular and ultimately pathogenic role for a subset of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, including the characterization of their downstream CNS mRNA targets, such as beta-secretase (BACE1) and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).  The intricate molecular networks mediated by an miRNA form a robust mechanism for rapid and potent responses to cellular events throughout the development of the human brain.  Disruption of miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation has been implicated in a range of CNS disorders as one miRNA is predicted to impact the expression of numerous downstream mRNA targets.  Hundreds of non-coding regulatory RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and are reported to mediate pivotal roles in many aspects of neuronal functions.  In recent years, there has been a shift in the conventional paradigms for transcriptional and translational regulation as extensive sequencing efforts have yielded new insights into the landscape of the human genome and transcriptome.  microRNAs in CNS disorders.
