The N-terminal region of the Listeria monocytogenes ActA protein, in conjunction with host cell factors, is sufficient for actin polymerization at the bacterial surface. Previous data suggested that ActA could protect barbed ends from capping proteins. We tested this hypothesis by actin polymerization experiments in the presence of the ActA N-terminal fragment and capping protein. ActA does not protect barbed ends from capping protein. In contrast, this polypeptide prevents PIP(2) from inhibiting the capping activity of capping protein. Gel filtration and tryptophan fluorescence experiments showed that the purified ActA N-terminal fragment binds to PIP(2) and PIP, defining phosphoinositides as novels ligands for this functional domain of ActA. Phosphoinositide binding to the N-terminal region of ActA may induce conformational changes in ActA and/or facilitate binding of other cell components, important for ActA-induced actin polymerization.

Twenty-nine epidemiological unrelated and mostly multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains from Peruvian patients. To investigate the molecular genetics of MDR-TB strains recovered in a Latin American country. Antimicrobial agent susceptibility testing, major genetic group designation, IS6110 fingerprinting, spoligotyping, and automated deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing of regions of the katG, rpoB, embB, gyrA, and pncA genes with mutations commonly associated with drug resistance. Nineteen isolates were found to be multidrug-resistant by susceptibility testing. IS6110 typing showed that virtually all isolates were unique and therefore had independently acquired drug resistance. Seventy-nine percent of isoniazid-resistant strains had a Ser315Thr amino acid change in KatG. Ninety-five percent of rifampin-resistant isolates had amino acid replacements in the rifampin-resistance determining region of RpoB. Six of 11 ethambutol-resistant strains had EmbB alterations. Eleven pyrazinamide-resistant strains had distinct mutations in pncA. Virtually all organisms evolved drug resistance independently. The types of drug resistance-associated mutations identified were very similar to changes occurring in isolates from other areas of the world. Nucleotide sequence-based strategies for rapid detection of drug resistance-conferring mutants will be applicable to organisms recovered in Peru, and potentially other areas of Latin America.  "

        "sentence": "Display of active subtilisin 309 on phage: analysis of parameters influencing the selection of subtilisin variants with changed substrate specificity from libraries using phosphonylating inhibitors. Many attempts have been made to endow enzymes with new catalytic activities. One general strategy involves the creation of random combinatorial libraries of mutants associated with an efficient screening or selection scheme. Phage display has been shown to greatly facilitate the selection of polypeptides with desired properties by establishing a close link between the polypeptide and the gene that encodes it. Selection of phage displayed enzymes for new catalytic activities remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to display the serine protease subtilisin 309 (savinase) from Bacillus lentus on the surface of filamentous fd phage and to develop selection schemes that allow the extraction of subtilisin variants with a changed substrate specificity from libraries. Subtilisins are produced as secreted preproenzyme that mature in active enzyme autocatalytically. They have a broad substrate specificity but exhibit a significant preference for hydrophobic residues and very limited reactivity toward charged residues at the P4 site in the substrate. Here, we show that savinase can be functionally displayed on phage in the presence of the proteic inhibitor CI2. The free enzyme is released from its complex with CI2 upon addition of the anionic detergent LAS. The phage-enzyme can be panned on streptavidin beads after labelling by reaction with (biotin-N-epsilon-aminocaproyl-cystamine-N'-glutaryl)-l-Ala-l-Ala-l-P ro-Phe(P)-diphenyl ester. Reactions of libraries, in which residues 104 and 107 forming part of the S4 pocket have been randomised, with (biotin-N-epsilon-aminocaproyl-cystamine-N'-glutaryl)-alpha-l-Lys-l-A la-l-Pro-Phe(P)-diphenylester allowed us to select enzymes with increased specific activity for a substrate containing a lysine in P4. Parameters influencing the selection as for instance the efficiency of maturation of mutant enzymes in libraries have been investigated.  "

Salmonella infection induces the generation of specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and both T cell populations are important for protection during primary and secondary responses, although the mechanisms underlying T cell-mediated protection are not yet completely understood. Infection with S. typhimurium also results in a strong antibody response to Salmonella antigens and, in contrast to most other intracellular bacteria, this antibody response participates in protection. In summary, the response to S. typhimurium involves both T and B cell-mediated immunity, and mechanisms mediated by both lymphocyte populations are important for control of primary infection and protection against secondary infection.

Individuals with either a late (C5-9) complement component deficiency (LCCD) or properdin deficiency are at increased risk to develop meningococcal disease, often due to serogroups W135 and Y. Anti-meningococcal defence in both LCCD persons and properdin-deficient individuals without bactericidal antibodies depends mainly on phagocytosis. Three types of opsonin receptors are involved in phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). These represent the polymorphic FcgammaRIIa (CD32) and FcgammaRIIIb (CD16b) receptors, and the C3 receptor CR3 (CD11b/CD18). When the distribution of FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIb allotypes was assessed in 15 LCCD and in 15 properdin-deficient patients with/without previous meningococcal disease, we found the combination of FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 with FcgammaRIIIb-NA2/NA2 allotypes to be associated with previous meningococcal disease (odds ratio 13.9, Fisher's test P = 0.036). No such relation was observed in the properdin-deficient patients. The importance of FcgammaRIIa allotypes was also demonstrated using in vitro phagocytosis assays. PMN from FcgammaRIIa-R/R131 homozygous donors internalized IgG2 opsonized meningococci W135 significantly (P < 0.05) less than PMN from FcgammaRIIa-H/H131 donors. When properdin-deficient serum was tested, it was observed that reconstitution with properdin resulted in enhanced PMN phagocytosis of the W135 meningococci (P = 0.001). This enhanced phagocytosis was parallelled by an increase in C3 deposition onto the opsonized meningococci W135 (r = 0.6568, P = 0. 01). We conclude that the occurrence of meningococcal disease in LCCD patients is associated with certain FcgammaR allotypes. Properdin-deficient individuals are susceptible to meningococcal disease because of an insufficient C3 deposition on the surface of meningococci, resulting in insufficient phagocytosis.  "

The Elp component, PDH, is encoded by two genes, pdhAalpha (1,047 bp) and pdhAbeta (1,383 bp), a situation encountered in the alpha-proteobacteria Rickettsia prowazekii and Zymomonas mobilis as well as in some gram-positive bacteria and in mitochondria. pdhAalpha and pdhAbeta precede pdhB (1,344 bp), which encodes the E2p component, dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, of the PDHc. No gene encoding the E3 component, lipoamide dehydrogenase, was found in the immediate vicinity of pdhA and pdhB genes. pdhAalpha, pdhAbeta and pdhB likely constitute an operon. Here, we provide evidence that pdhA expression is induced in the symbiotic stage, compared with free-living conditions. We demonstrate that symbiotic expression of pdhA genes does not depend on the fix LJ regulatory cascade that regulates nitrogen fixation and respiration gene expression in symbiotic S. meliloti cells. Induction of pdhA expression could be obtained under free-living conditions upon the addition of pyruvate to the culture medium. Induction by pyruvate and symbiotic activation of pdh gene expression take place at the same promoter.  "

Infected cells were incubated with antibiotics at dosages representing the expected urinary concentrations in a 10-year-old, 30-kg child to evaluate bacterial invasion and survival. All cell lines showed colocalization of P. mirabilis with human colonic mucin (i.e., MUC2) and human gastric mucin (i.e., MUC5AC). The correlation between membrane mucin expression and invasion was significant and opposite for SV-HUC-1 and HT29-MTX. Microscopically, invasion by P. mirabilis with intracellular crystal formation and mitochondrial damage was found. Double membranes surrounded bacteria in intestinal cells. Relative resistance to cotrimoxazole and augmentin was found in the presence of epithelial cells. Ciprofloxacin and gentamicin remained effective. Membrane mucin expression was correlated with relative antibiotic resistance. Cell invasion by P. mirabilis and mucin- and cell type-related distribution and response differences indicate bacterial tropism that affects crystal formation and mucosal presence. Bacterial invasion seems to have cell type-dependent mechanisms and prolong bacterial survival in antibiotic therapy, giving a new target for therapeutic optimalization of antibiotic treatment.  "

Infection due to Staphylococcus aureus continues to be a source of significant morbidity and mortality.

Apart from the two recognized modes of staphylococcal resistance, namely, penicillinase production and intrinsic resistance, Sabath and associates have described a third type in which resistance is manifested by susceptibility to growth inhibition but tolerance to the lethal action of bactericidal agents. The mechanism of tolerance is attributed to a deficiency of autolytic enzyme activity in the part of bacteria, possibly secondary to an inhibition of autolysins in the tolerant staphylococcal strains. These strains are found in patients with infections responding poorly to treatment with cell-wall active antibiotics including vancomycin. Because of its unique mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic properties, rifampin has been reported to be the most active among 65 antistaphylococcal agents tested and have the capacity to kill intraleukocytic staphylococci.

We have used transposable elements to identify chromosomal locations in the obligate methanotroph Methylomonas sp. strain 16a that support high-level expression of genes involved in the synthesis of the C(40) carotenoids canthaxanthin and astaxanthin. with three promoterless carotenoid transposons, five chromosomal locations-the fliCS, hsdM, ccp-3, cysH, and nirS regions-were identified. Total carotenoid synthesis increased 10- to 20-fold when the carotenoid gene clusters were inserted at these chromosomal locations compared to when the same carotenoid gene clusters were integrated at neutral locations under the control of the promoter for the gene conferring resistance to chloramphenicol. A chromosomal integration system based on sucrose lethality was used to make targeted gene deletions or site-specific integration of the carotenoid gene cluster into the Methylomonas genome without leaving genetic scars in the chromosome from the antibiotic resistance genes that are present on the integration vector. The genetic approaches described in this work demonstrate how metabolic engineering of microorganisms, including the less-studied environmental isolates, can be greatly enhanced by identifying integration sites within the chromosome of the host that permit optimal expression of the target genes.

Regulation of cytotoxic effector molecule expression in human CTLs after viral or bacterial activation is poorly understood. By using human autologous dendritic cells (DCs) to prime T lymphocytes, we found perforin only highly up-regulated in virus- (HSV-1, vaccinia virus) but not in intracellular bacteria- (Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae) activated CTLs. In contrast, larger quantities of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were produced in Listeria-stimulated cultures. Granzyme B and granulysin were similarly up-regulated by all tested viruses and intracellular bacteria. DCs infected with HSV-1 showed enhanced surface expression of the costimulatory molecule CD252 (CD134L) compared with Listeria-infected DC and induced enhanced secretion of IL-2. Adding blocking CD134 or neutralizing IL-2 Abs during T cell activation reduced the HSV-dependent up-regulation of perforin. These data indicate a distinct CTL effector function in response to intracellular pathogens triggered via differing endogenous IL-2 production upon costimulation through CD252.  "

Microbial systems have become the preferred testing grounds for experimental work on the evolution of traits that benefit other group members. This work, based on conceptual and theoretical models of frequency-dependent selection within populations, has proven fruitful in terms of understanding the dynamics of group beneficial or 'public goods' traits within species. Here, we expand the scope of microbial work on the evolution of group-beneficial traits to the case of multi-species communities, particularly those that affect human health. We examined whether beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli could protect ampicillin-sensitive cohorts of other species, particularly species that could cause human disease. Both beta-lactamase-secreting E. coli and, surprisingly, those engineered to retain it, allowed for survival of a large number of ampicillin-sensitive cohorts of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, including both laboratory and clinical isolates. The Salmonella survivors, however, remained sensitive to ampicillin when re-plated onto solid medium and there was no evidence of gene transfer. Salmonella survival did not even require direct physical contact with the resistant E. coli. The observed phenomenon appears to involve increased release of beta-lactamase from the E. coli when present with S. enterica. Significantly, these findings imply that resistant E. coli, that are not themselves pathogenic, may be exploited, even when they are normally selfish with respect to other E. coli. Thus, Salmonella can gain protection against antibiotics from E. coli without gene transfer, a phenomenon not previously known. As a consequence, antibiotic-resistant E. coli can play a decisive role in the survival of a species that causes disease and may thereby interfere with successful treatment.  "

During innate immune responses, the inflammatory CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 mediate the recruitment of blood monocytes to infected tissues by promoting cell migration in response to chemokines CCL2-5. Toll-like receptors also play an essential role, allowing pathogen recognition by the recruited monocytes. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus leads to gradual down-modulation of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 from the plasma membrane of human blood-isolated monocytes and inhibits chemotaxis. Interestingly, LTA does not promote rapid desensitization of chemokine-mediated calcium responses. We found that the TLR2 crosstalk with chemokine receptors is not dependent on the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein, but instead involves phospholipase C, the small G protein Rac1, and is phorbol ester sensitive. Activation of this pathway by LTA lead to β-arrestin-mediated endocytosis of Ser349-phosphorylated CCR5 into recycling endosomes, as does CCL5 treatment. However, LTA-induced internalization of CCR5 is a slower process associated with phospholipase C-mediated and phorbol ester-sensitive phosphorylation. Overall, our data indicate that TLR2 negatively regulates CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 on human blood monocytes by activating the machinery used to support chemokine-dependent down-modulation and provide a molecular mechanism for inhibiting monocyte migration after pathogen recognition.

Chlorosomes are light-harvesting antennae of photosynthetic bacteria containing large numbers of self-aggregated bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. They have developed unique photophysical properties that enable them to absorb light and transfer the excitation energy with very high efficiency. However, the molecular-level organization, that produces the photophysical properties of BChl molecules in the aggregates, is still not fully understood. One of the reasons is heterogeneity in the chlorosome structure which gives rise to a hierarchy of structural and energy disorder. In this report, we for the first time directly measure absorption linear dichroism (LD) on individual, isolated chlorosomes. Together with fluorescence-detected three-dimensional LD, these experiments reveal a large amount of disorder on the single-chlorosome level in the form of distributions of LD observables in chlorosomes from wild-type bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum . Fluorescence spectral parameters, such as peak wavelength and bandwidth, are measures of the aggregate excitonic properties. These parameters obtained on individual chlorosomes are uncorrelated with the observed LD distributions and indicate that the observed disorder is due to inner structural disorder along the chlorosome long axis. The excitonic disorder that is also present is not manifested in the LD distributions. Limiting values of the LD parameter distributions, which are relatively free of the effect of structural disorder, define a range of angles at which the excitonic dipole moment is oriented with respect to the surface of the two-dimensional aggregate of BChl molecules. Experiments on chlorosomes of a triple mutant of Chlorobaculum tepidum show that the mutant chlorosomes have significantly less inner structural disorder and higher symmetry, compatible with a model of well-ordered concentric cylinders. Different values of the transition dipole moment orientations are consistent with a different molecular level organization of BChl's in the mutant and wild-type chlorosomes.  "

Molecular characterisation was carried out on isolates obtained from nasal swabs from 105 calves from 32 randomly selected beef and dairy farms located throughout Scotland, and from 131 calves from 20 farms in the Mayenne region of France, where sampling occurred in response to respiratory disease outbreaks. P. multocida isolates were characterised by random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using restriction enzyme ApaI. In addition, isolates representative of each farm/RAPD profile combination were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Among 105 Scottish isolates, 15 RAPD profiles were distinguished. The majority of farms (27/32) had indistinguishable profiles in all positive animals. Five farms had two profiles. Among 140 French isolates, 23 RAPD profiles were distinguished. More within-farm heterogeneity was observed although 10/20 farms had just one profile (E4) in sampled calves. Profile E4 accounted for 60% (84/140) of French isolates. PFGE was more discriminatory than RAPD but confirmed results with respect to within farm homogeneity or heterogeneity of strains, whereas MLST was not discriminatory enough for farm level epidemiology. As in other host species, either several strains or one dominant strain of P. multocida may exist within farms, with evidence for a role of management factors such as movements onto the farm in the number of strains detected.

The Escherichia coli plasmid-encoded urease, a virulence factor in human and animal infections of the urinary and gastroduodenal tracts, is induced when the substrate urea is present in the growth medium. Urea-dependent urease expression is mediated at the transcriptional level by the AraC-like activator UreR. Previous work has shown that a peptide representing the N-terminal 194 amino-acid residues of UreR binds urea at a single site, full-length UreR forms an oligomer, and the oligomerization motif is thought to reside in the N-terminal portion of the molecule. The C-terminal domain of UreR contains two helix-turn-helix motifs presumed to be necessary for DNA binding. In this study, we exploited mutational analyses at the N-terminal domain of UreR to determine if this domain dimerizes similar to other AraC family members. UreR mutants were analyzed for the ability to activate transcription of lacZ from an ureDp-lacZ transcriptional fusion. A construct encoding the N-terminal 194 amino acids of UreR, eluted as an oligomer by gel filtration and had a dominant negative phenotype over the wild-type ureR allele. We hypothesize that this dominant negative phenotype results from the formation of inactive heterodimers between wild-type and truncated UreR.

We present genome-wide maps of transcriptional start sites (TSS) for both organisms, which are representatives of the two most diverse clades within the two major ecotypes adapted to high- and low-light conditions, respectively. Our data suggest antisense transcription for three-quarters of all genes, which is substantially more than that observed in other bacteria. We discovered hundreds of TSS within genes, most notably within 16 of the 29 prochlorosin genes, in strain MIT9313. A direct comparison revealed very little conservation in the location of TSS and the nature of non-coding transcripts between both strains. We detected extremely short 5' untranslated regions with a median length of only 27 and 29 nt for MED4 and MIT9313, respectively, and for 8% of all protein-coding genes the median distance to the start codon is only 10 nt or even shorter. These findings and the absence of an obvious Shine-Dalgarno motif suggest that leaderless translation and ribosomal protein S1-dependent translation constitute alternative mechanisms for translation initiation in Prochlorococcus.

A high carriage rate did not correlate with the wet or dry season. The carriage rate of children in rural areas was similar to that of children in urban areas. Children in day-care centres or nurseries had a surprisingly low carriage rate (2%). The carriage rate of H. influenzae b was compared to the presence of H. influenzae subspecies in a random sample, which revealed that H. influenzae subspecies was found in 90% of the children under 5 years old. Encapsulated strains of H. influenzae were found in 25% of the same sample, two-thirds of which were not type b. All capsule types were represented. No meningitis cases occurred in the survey populations. We conclude that the prevalence of H. influenzae b in open Gambian communities is similar to that in closed communities elsewhere, but that the kinetics are different from those in closed communities, as persistence of infection in Gambian children is short-lived.

To construct a host-vector system in an n-alkane-assimilating yeast, Candida maltosa, the isolation of an ARS site from its genome which replicates autonomously in C. maltosa was attempted. Leu- mutants of C. maltosa were transformed with a gene library prepared by using YEp13 (LEU2+) as a vector, and Leu+ transformants were obtained at a high frequency. A plasmid named pCS1 was isolated from the recipient cells. pCS1 contained a 6.3-kilobase (kb) fragment of the C. maltosa genome, and a 3.8-kb fragment with ARS activity was subcloned and designated the TRA (transformation ability) region. Vectors (pTRA1 and pTRA11) for C. maltosa J288 were constructed that contained this 3.8-kb fragment, pBR322, and the LEU2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transformation of C. maltosa J288 with these plasmids was successful by both spheroplast and lithium acetate methods. Southern blot analysis suggested that the copy number of pTRA1 in C. maltosa was between 10 and 20, and it was stably maintained during growth without selective pressure in the medium. It was also found that these vectors could transform S. cerevisiae leu2- to LEU2+, suggesting that the TRA region contained an ARS site(s) that was specific not only for C. maltosa but also for S. cerevisiae.

An enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain (strain 2230), isolated from a patient with acute infantile diarrhea, was found to adhere only to the brush border of human intestinal epithelial cells. This strain does not hemagglutinate human, bovine, chicken, or guinea pig erythrocytes. The adhesion of E. coli 2230 appears to be mediated by a nonfimbrial bacterial surface protein of 16,000 daltons which can be extracted by heating the bacteria at 60 degrees C for 20 min. This surface protein is implicated as an adhesive factor because pretreatment of enterocytes with this protein extract completely inhibits the adhesion of E. coli 2230. This adhesive factor is serologically distinct from other adhesive factors found in enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. A plasmid DNA of 66 megadaltons is involved in the synthesis of this nonfimbrial adhesive factor.  "

Two Ec-like SOS boxes have been located upstream from Ah lexA, the distance between them being 4 bp, whereas this same distance in Ec lexA is 5 bp. The structure and sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor of Ec, as well as the region at which its hydrolysis occurs, are highly conserved in Ah LexA. Moreover, a residue of the region implicated in the specific cleavage reaction, and which is present in all known RecA-cleavable repressors, is changed in the Ah LexA. Expression of Ah lexA is DNA-damage inducible in both the Ah and Ec genetic backgrounds to the same extent. In contrast, Ec lexA is poorly induced in DNA-injured Ah cells.  "

Swelling of the hind paws was detected within 8 h of infection, increased rapidly, and peaked at 21 h. This initial swelling decreased, and by day 4 only slight swelling was detected. Severe swelling of the hind paws was detected 8 days after infection and increased rapidly, with peak swelling occurring on day 11. Histopathologic examination affirmed that macrophages exposed to Formalin-inactivated spirochetes induced a severe destructive Lyme arthritis. The onset and severity of the severe destructive arthritis were dependent on the number of macrophages transferred. By contrast, macrophages not exposed to Formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi failed to induce severe destructive arthritis in recipients after challenge with B. burgdorferi. Similarly, severe destructive arthritis was not detected in recipients of macrophages injected with spirochetal growth medium. Our results also showed that transferred macrophages could not protect hamsters from infection with B. burgdorferi, as spirochetes were readily recovered from their tissues when cultured.

The behaviour of the 10 strains was the same except for VS368, which was the most rapid E. faecalis strain (t*: 0·5 h) and, at the same time, the one showing the highest Ehmin (−189 mV). At 37°C, the mean curves for E. faecium, E. durans and L. lactis ssp. lactis  had similar Eh evolution (sharp decrease around the second hour of  culture), but the minimum values were different. The strains of L. lactis ssp. lactis were more reducing than the strains of the other two species: Ehmin: −162 ± 32·9 mV vs−138 ± 31·3 and −120 ± 29·0, respectively (Fig. 2). The 10 strains of E. faecium  had similar reduction power, although after 24 h of incubation  three strains, FK5, FK6 and FK7, isolated from Scimudin cheese, showed  higher reducing activity than the other seven. The slowest and least  reducing strain, 174, was isolated from Caciocavallo Ragusano cheese.  The E. durans strains showed similar Eh evolution over  24 h, except for VS263 isolated from Formagèla Valseriana cheese.  VS263 was the fastest to achieve Ehmin and Δmax (tmin: 2·0 h; t*: 1·0 h) and had higher reduction power (Ehmin: −171 mV) than the others. The L. lactis ssp. lactis strains had the highest reduction activity after the E. faecalis strains. Their Ehmin values were: −162 ± 32·9 mV, and they were characterized by a rapid decrease in tmin 3·8 ± 0·8 h and t*  2·2 ± 0·3 h. Once again ‘atypical’ behaviour was  detected in the strains isolated from Formagèla Valseriana, namely VS179  and VS180, these being revealed to have lower reduction power compared  with the other lactococci belonging to the same species. Streptococcus thermophilus,  the major species used as the starter culture in cheese manufacture,  was the slowest of the tested LAB species. Its reduction activity  increased constantly, and it consequently had a smaller Δmax; all the strains reached Ehmin  at the end of the 24-h incubation period, the exception being O2A  isolated from Fontina, found to be the most reducing and reaching Ehmin after 14 h. Instead, strain LOD11 was the slowest S. thermophilus strain (t*: 4·5 h), however it also had the highest Ehmin (−45 mV). Among the lactobacilli, the highest reducing species was L. paracasei ssp. paracasei: their strains showed the lowest Ehmin (−169 ± 13·8 mV), and were the fastest to achieve Δmax (4·2 ± 1·3 h). The B1B strain showed similar behaviour to the enterococci (Ehmin: −186; t*: 3 h) (Table 3). On the contrary, the BB3 strain isolated from Formai de Mut cheese was very slow: it took 12 h to reach Ehmin. The redox curve of L. paracasei ssp. paracasei, comparable with that of E. faecalis and reaching similar final values, shows a more gradual slope (lower Δmax) reached over longer times. With regard to the strains of L. plantarum,  the redox potential course is characterized by an initial stabilizing  period followed by a rapid and consistent decrease corresponding to the  major Δmax (229 ± 88·6 mV) found among the  tested lactobacilli. This species showed good reduction power and was as  fast in reaching Δmax as L. paracasei ssp. paracasei. The lowest reducing lactobacilli were found to be L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (Ehmin: −54 ± 20·4 mV and −54 ± 23·8 mV). Furthermore, for both the thermophilic lactobacilli species, Eh decreased slowly (L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus: t*: 6·0 ± 1·7 h and L. helveticus t*: 6·4 ± 1·6 h), the mean curves showing similar evolution over the 24-h period. All the strains of P. pentosaceus had poor reduction activity.

Most of the selected isolates for this  investigation came from cheeses produced in the mountains, and it is  interesting to note that the majority of the strains from Scimudin  cheese (77·7%) were the fastest to achieve Ehmin, while the  strains isolated from Formai de Mut took more time to reach the minimum  Eh value. Isolated from Formagèla Valseriana were the strains L. lactis ssp. lactis and E. durans;  these strains, except for VS263, showed lower reduction power than the  other strains of the same species, but, nevertheless, took less time.

This result is in agreement with previous  studies reporting that B. linens was not a significant member  of the surface microbiota of smear cheese, even though it is still used  as the major component of ripening cultures ( Brennan et al., 2002; Gori et al., 2013). It is also possible that other preponderant bacteria such as Psychrobacter and Staphylococcus play a role in the coloration of smear cheeses. As described previously ( Hoppe-Seyler et al., 2007), the yellow-orange color of the rind of these cheeses could be due to interactions between pigmented or nonpigmented B. linens and yellow-pigmented Arthrobacter ( Ogier et al., 2004; Leclercq-Perlat and Spinnler, 2010).

Watanabe et al. (2014) reported that the addition of Propionibacteria to cabbage during sauerkraut production resulted in higher concentrations of B12 (7.2 μg/100 mL). Although we produced less vitamin B12 than their fermentations, our samples do not have the pungent odor from propionic acid.In this work cofermentation of glycerol and fructose was also confirmed to have a positive effect on the production of vitamin B12 (Table 1). Glycerol is a vital interesting topic not only for vitamin B12 production but also for the growth of cells. Glycerol works as an inducer of vitamin B12 synthesis cluster (Roth et al., 1996). In Fig. 1, cobT and cbiA genes were obviously induced by glycerol, but cbiA was induced more than cobT. The increase expression of both enzymes accelerated the synthesis of vitamin B12 and led to a higher production of vitamin B12. In this condition, vitamin B12 synthesis also increased the production of vitamin B12 analogs.Vitamin B12 dependent enzymes in L. reuteri are involved in the conversion from glycerol to 3-HPA in order to regenerate NAD+  with more ATP generation. Some researchers demonstrated that glycerol  serves only as an external hydrogen acceptor in the glycerol  fermentation of L. reuteri, and does not work as a carbon source ( Sriramulu et al., 2008). Our work of glycerol used as an external hydrogen acceptor (Table 2) is in agreement with the above results. An obvious shift of end products from ethanol to acetate was observed in our results (Table 2). Similar results were found in the work of Lüthi-Peng et al. (2002)  and coworkers. They stated that a sufficient supplementation of glucose  compared to glycerol could improve the generation of 1, 3-propanediol  and acetate, and reduced the accumulation of 3-HPA and lactate. Vitamin B12 production (Table 1)  was indeed improved with the supplementation of glycerol since glucose  was utilized via a more efficient pathway to generate ATP and glucose  was not involved in the redox balance, but high concentrations of  glycerol supplementations in our work definitely inhibited the growth of  cells. It may attribute to an activity of glycerol dehydratase  inhibited by a quorum sensing of reuterin (Bauer et al., 2010). "
