The distinction between benign florid lymphoid hyperplasia and low-grade gastric mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma may be a challenge. The presence of monoclonal B cells in Helicobacter pylori-chronic active gastritis has suggested that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data should be viewed with caution. We investigated the reliability of PCR versus immunophenotyping in diagnosing early gastric MALT lymphoma. We studied 1511 biopsies from eight patients with high-grade primary gastric lymphoma, 25 with low-grade MALT lymphoma, 32 with atypical lymphoid infiltrates, and 39 with Helicobacter pylori-chronic active gastritis. Paraffin sections from all cases were stained with antibodies to CD20, CD3, AE1/AE3, kappa and lambda. PCR was performed on paraffin sections using the primer set VH-FR3/J(H). Using histopathology as the gold standard in diagnosis, we confirmed monoclonality in 22 of 25 MALT lymphomas (88%); a clonal band was found in 38% (15 of 39) of patients with chronic active gastritis. An immunophenotype pattern with predominance of CD20-positive cells in lymphocytic infiltrates was associated with monoclonality in 92% of cases. The presence of an enlarged irregular mantle zone was found in both monoclonal and polyclonal areas. An equal prevalence of B and T cells in lymphocytic infiltrates was associated with a polyclonal pattern in 24 of 31 cases (77%). Immunostaining of sIg (kappa and lambda) was difficult in paraffin sections and convincing proof of monoclonality was not obtained. Lymphoepithelial lesions were infrequent in gastric biopsies and their presence was highlighted with keratin stains. Because monoclonal B cells are observed in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, the correct interpretation of clonality by PCR remains unclear. Paraffin section IHC using CD20 and CD3 is especially useful to confirm the diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma.

A total of 413 samples from different sources (product from (i) different stages of processing, (ii) different environments, and (iii) different food handlers), collected from a chicken nugget processing plant, were analysed by both rapid methods and a cultural method consisting of pre-enrichment, enrichment, and isolation onto selective agars (PALCAM, LPM, and HCLA). Overall, results showed an excellent correlation between data obtained using Clearview and the cultural method, with Clearview presenting an efficiency of 99%. Bax showed a lower correlation using the cultural method, with an efficiency of 71.1%. The type of sample did not affect the efficiency of Clearview, which varied from 98.1% for product samples to 100% for environmental and food handler samples, while for Bax it had a marked influence. Efficiency of Bax varied from as high as 100% for food handlers to 37.9% for product samples.

The incidence of gastric cancer and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori are high in Japan, so it is an important issue whether long-term H. pylori infection leads to chronic atrophic gastritis, considered one of the precursors of gastric cancer. We have reported that the grade of atrophy was higher in H. pylori-positive subjects than in H. pylori-negative subjects. It has also been reported that the atrophy of gastric mucosa increased in H. pylori-infected monkeys compared with control monkeys in a 5-year follow-up study. Most H. pylori infections occur in children, and atrophy of the gastric mucosa progresses during aging. Long-term data show that H. pylori infection can lead to gastric atrophy and may play an important role in the development of gastric cancer. Interestingly, there was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori between patients with chronic gastritis and gastric cancer in Japan, but the prevalence of H. pylori in young Japanese gastric cancer patients was significantly higher than in the control group. These data clearly show that H. pylori infection is one of the risk factors of gastric cancer in young Japanese people, There is no answer to whether curing H. pylori infection can reverse the atrophy of the gastric mucosa and decrease the risk of gastric cancer development. To clarify this issue, an intervention study must be done. A large clinical trial called the Japanese Intervention Trial of H. pylori is in progress.

The genomes of spotted fever group rickettsiae isolated in different geographical areas of Israel (two from ticks and four from humans, obtained over a span of 20 years) were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction endonuclease fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The human isolates were obtained from patients suffering from rickettsial disease of different degrees of severity. The PCR products obtained with five pairs of oligonucleotide primers (two primer sets derived from the 190-kDa polypeptide gene and three from the 120-kDa polypeptide gene) and cleaved with restriction endonucleases were used to study the Israeli isolates and reference Rickettsia conorii isolates. Subtle differences between the PCR-RFLP patterns of Israeli isolates and the two R. conorii reference strains (Moroccan and no. 7) were seen when the PCR products derived from the 190-kDa gene-derived primer sets were digested. All of the Israeli isolates were identical by RFLP analysis using all of the primer sets. This study showed that the Israeli spotted fever group isolates (from both ticks and humans) were genetically homogeneous by the criteria used in this study, despite the time and location differences in their original isolation, and different as a group from R. conorii.

Despite recent reports of clonal strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) units, the need for routine microbiological surveillance remains contentious. Sputum was collected prospectively from productive patients attending the regional paediatric and adult CF units in Brisbane, Australia. All P. aeruginosa isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Spirometry, anthropometrics, hospitalisations and antibiotic sensitivity data were recorded. The first 100 sputum samples (first 50 patients at each clinic) harboured 163 isolates of P. aeruginosa. A total of 39 patients shared a common strain (pulsotype 2), 20 patients shared a strain with at least one other patient and 41 patients harboured unique strains. Eight patients shared a strain identical to a previously reported Australian transmissible strain (pulsotype 1). Compared with the unique strain group, patients harbouring pulsotype 2 were younger and had poorer lung function. Treatment requirements were similar in these two groups, as were the rates of multiresistance. In conclusion, 59% of patients harboured a clonal strain, supporting the need for routine microbiological surveillance. In contrast to previously described clonal strains, the dominant pulsotype was indistinguishable from nonclonal strains with respect to both colonial morphology and multiresistance. The clinical significance of clonal strains remains uncertain and requires longitudinal study.

of Helicobacter pylori infection 1 year after successful treatment: prospective cohort study in the Republic of Yemen. To investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in the Republic of Yemen and the recurrence rate 1 year after apparently successful eradication. A total of 275 patients with chronic dyspepsia seen in one clinic were enrolled. Gastric biopsies were obtained at endoscopy and H. pylori infection was diagnosed using the rapid urease test. Patients with H. pylori infection were given either clarithromycin or metronidazole-based triple therapy. Six weeks later H. pylori status was assessed using the C-urea breath test (C-UBT). Those who were negative for H. pylori had a further C-UBT after 1 year to establish the recurrence rate. The prevalence of H. pylori infection at entry to the study was 82.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 78-87%]. The overall eradication rate 6 weeks after treatment was 49.1% (95% CI 42.6-55.6%) by intention-to-treat analysis, and 60% (95% CI 53-67%) by per-protocol analysis. Recurrence rate of H. pylori infection at 1 year was 34% (95% CI 14-45%) and the only predictor of recurrence was an excess delta C-UBT value less than 3.5 per million but equal to or greater than 2.5 per million at 6 weeks after treatment (odds ratio 2.28; 95% CI 1.17-4.44; P = 0.028). The prevalence of H. pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in Yemen is very high, the eradication rate with standard triple therapy was unsatisfactory probably because of widespread bacterial resistance due to unrestricted antibiotic use. The recurrence rate of infection at 1 year was high, as a result of recrudescence of incompletely eradicated organisms rather than reinfection.

This paper provides a preliminary picture of diarrhea with regards to etiology, clinical symptoms, and some related epidemiologic factors in children less than five years of age living in Hanoi, Vietnam. The study population included 587 children with diarrhea and 249 age-matched healthy controls. The identification of pathogens was carried out by the conventional methods in combination with ELISA, immunoseparation, and PCR. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by MIC following the NCCLS recommendations. Of those with diarrhea, 40.9% were less than one year old and 71.0% were less than two years old. A potential pathogen was identified in 67.3% of children with diarrhea. They were group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, with prevalences of 46.7%, 22.5%, 4.7%, and 7.3%, respectively. No Salmonella spp or Vibrio cholerae were isolated. Rotavirus and diarrheagenic E. coli were predominant in children less than two years of age, while Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were mostly seen in the older children. Diarrheagenic E. coli and Shigella spp showed high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Children attending the hospitals had fever (43.6%), vomiting (53.8%), and dehydration (82.6%). Watery stool was predominant with a prevalence of 66.4%, followed by mucous stool (21.0%). The mean episodes of stools per day was seven, ranging from two to 23 episodes. Before attending hospitals, 162/587 (27.6%) children had been given antibiotics. Overall, more children got diarrhea in (i) poor families; (ii) families where piped water and a latrine were lacking; (iii) families where mothers washed their hands less often before feeding the children; (iv) families where mothers had a low level of education; (v) families where information on health and sanitation less often reached their households. Group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis play an important role in causing diarrhea in children in Hanoi, Vietnam. Epidemiological factors such as lack of fresh water supply, unhygienic septic tank, low family income, lack of health information, and low educational level of parents could contribute to the morbidity of diarrhea in children.

sequestration and protection by the MerR metal-binding domain (MBD). MerR, the metalloregulator of the bacterial mercury resistance (mer) operon, binds Hg(II) with high affinity. To study the mechanism of metal-induced activation, a small protein was previously engineered embodying in a single polypeptide the metal-binding domain (MBD) ordinarily formed between two monomers of MerR. Here the physiological and biochemical properties of MBD expressed on the cell surface or in the cytosol were examined, to better understand the environments in which specific metal binding can occur with this small derivative. Over 20 000 surface copies of MBD were expressed per Escherichia coli cell, with metal stoichiometries of approximately 1.0 Hg(II) per MBD monomer. Cells expressing MBD on their surface in rich medium bound 6.1-fold more Hg(II) than those not expressing MBD. Although in nature cells use the entire mer operon to detoxify mercury, it was interesting to note that cells expressing only MBD survived Hg(II) challenge and recovered more quickly than cells without MBD. Cell-surface-expressed MBD bound Hg(II) preferentially even in the presence of a 22-fold molar excess of Zn(II) and when exposed to equimolar Cd(II) in addition. MBD expressed in the cystosol also afforded improved survival from Hg(II) exposure for E. coli and for the completely unrelated bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans.

This study investigated rickettsial infection in animals, humans, ticks, and fleas collected in five areas of the state of São Paulo. Eight flea species (Adoratopsylla antiquorum antiquorum, Ctenocephalides felis felis, Polygenis atopus, Polygenis rimatus, Polygenis roberti roberti, Polygenis tripus, Rhopalopsyllus lugubris, and Rhopalopsyllus lutzi lutzi), and five tick species (Amblyomma aureolatum, Amblyomma cajennense, Amblyomma dubitatum, Ixodes loricatus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) were collected from dogs, cats, and opossums. Rickettsia felis was the only rickettsia found infecting fleas, whereas Rickettsia bellii was the only agent infecting ticks, but no animal or human blood was shown to contain rickettsial DNA. Testing animal and human sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay against four rickettsia antigens (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, and R. bellii), some opossum, dog, horse, and human sera reacted to R. rickettsii with titers at least four-fold higher than to the other three rickettsial antigens. These sera were considered to have a predominant antibody response to R. rickettsii. Using the same criteria, opossum, dog, and horse sera showed predominant antibody response to R. parkeri or a very closely related genotype. Our serological results suggest that both R. rickettsii and R. parkeri infected animals and/or humans in the studied areas.

metabolome analysis using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. In this report, we introduce a liquid chromatography single-mass spectrometry method for metabolome quantification, using the LTQ Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer. Analytes were separated with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. At a working resolution of 30,000 (at m/z 400), the limit of detection varied from 50 fmol to 5 pmol for 25 metabolites tested. In terms of metabolite concentration, the linearity was about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude for most compounds (R(2)>0.99). To determine the accuracy of the system in complex sample matrices, the isotope dilution method was evaluated from mixtures of pure compounds and uniformly 13C-labeled cell extracts. With the application of this method, quantification was possible within single runs even when the pool sizes of individual metabolites varied from 0.13 to 55.6 microM. As a case study, intracellular concentrations of central metabolites were determined for Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 during growth on two different carbon sources, methanol and succinate. Reproducible results from technical and biological repetitions were obtained that revealed significant variations of intracellular metabolite pool sizes, depending on the carbon source. The LTQ Obitrap offers new perspectives and strategies for metabolome quantification.

Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is one of the most infectious human bacterial pathogens. It is phagocytosed by immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. The precise mechanisms that initiate bacterial uptake have not yet been elucidated. Participation of C3, CR3, class A scavenger receptors and mannose receptor in bacterial uptake have been already reported. However, contribution of an additional, as-yet-unidentified receptor for F. tularensis internalization has been suggested. We show here that cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a receptor for Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) and promotes LVS binding and infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. The HB-19 pseudopeptide that binds specifically carboxy-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin inhibits LVS binding and infection of monocyte-like THP-1 cells. In a pull-down assay, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a GTP-binding protein involved in protein translation, usually found in cytoplasm, was recovered among LVS bacterial membrane proteins bound on RGG domain of nucleolin. A specific polyclonal murine antibody was raised against recombinant LVS EF-Tu. By fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments, we found that a fraction of EF-Tu could be detected at the bacterial surface. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies reduced LVS binding to monocyte-like THP-1 cells and impaired infection, even in absence of complement and complement receptors. Interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin was illustrated by two different pull-down assays using recombinant EF-Tu proteins and either RGG domain of nucleolin or cell solubilized nucleolin. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the interaction between surface nucleolin and its bacterial ligand EF-Tu plays an important role in Francisella tularensis adhesion and entry process and may therefore facilitate invasion of host tissues. Since phagosomal escape and intra-cytosolic multiplication of LVS in infected monocytes are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis, the mechanism of entry into monocyte-like THP-1 cells, involving interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin, might be similar in the two subspecies. Thus, the use of either nucleolin-specific pseudopeptide HB-19 or recombinant EF-Tu could provide attractive therapeutic approaches for modulating F. tularensis infection.

Bile resistance is one of the basic characteristics of probiotic bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of bile resistance in lactococci by studying the relationship between bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in lactococcci grown on different media. We determined the bile resistance of 14 strains in lactose-free M17 medium supplemented with either glucose only (GM17) or lactose only (LM17). Gas chromatographic analyses of free lipids extracted from the tested strains were used for determining their fatty acid composition. A correlation analysis of all strains grown in both media revealed significant positive correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and negative correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid. It is also a fact that the fatty acids associated with bile resistance depended on species, strain, and/or growth medium. In L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains grown in GM17 medium, the bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In LM17 medium, bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid and significantly less C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, bile resistances of some of the tested strains were altered by growth medium. Some strains were resistant to bile in GM17 medium but sensitive to bile in LM17 medium. Some strains were resistant in both media tested. The strains grown in GM17 medium had significantly more hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and significantly less tetradecanoic acid, octadecadienoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the strains grown in LM17 medium. In conclusion, the fatty acid compositions of the bile-resistant lactococci differed from those of the bile-sensitive ones. More importantly, our data suggest that altering their fatty acid composition (i.e. increased hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid and decreased hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid) by changing growth conditions may be a useful way to enhance their bile resistance in lactococci.

of thermotolerant Campylobacter in partridges (Perdix perdix). To estimate the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. in commercially reared partridges (Perdix perdix) in southern Italy. Cloacal swabs of partridges (n = 240), equally distributed between male and female birds, from a game bird farm located in the Southern Italy were examined for the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. The samples were processed in order to detect thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. by culture methods. The positive samples were then confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 118 (49.2%) of the 240 cloacal swabs examined. As proved by PCR, 100% of the strains were identified as Campylobacter coli (118/118), and 15 (12.7%) out of the 118 positive samples were also positive for Campylobacter jejuni. In contrast, Campylobacter lari was not identified. Adult partridges showed a significantly higher prevalence (P < 0.05) than younger ones. These results reinforce the assumption that game birds may be considered as potential carriers of Campylobacter spp. for human being and other animal species. Although an earlier 1986 publication described the prevalence of Campylobacter coli in commercially reared partridges, this is the first report to confirm the species of Campylobacter using a PCR test.

general strategy for the bacterial expression of amyloidogenic peptides using BCL-XL-1/2 fusions. Biophysical studies on amyloidogenic and aggregation-prone peptides often require large quantities of material. However, solid-phase synthesis, handling, and purification of peptides often present challenges on these scales. Recombinant expression is an attractive alternative because of its low cost, the ability to isotopically label the peptides, and access to sequences exceeding approximately 50 residues. However, expression systems that seek to solubilize amyloidogenic peptides suffer from low yields, difficult optimizations, and isolation challenges. We present a general strategy for expressing and isolating amyloidogenic peptides in Escherichia coli by fusion to a polypeptide that drives the expression of attached peptides into bacterial inclusion bodies. This scheme minimizes toxicity during bacterial growth and enables the processing and handling of the peptides in denaturing solutions. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography, reverse phase HPLC, and cyanogen bromide cleavage are used to isolate the peptide, followed by further reverse phase HPLC, which yields milligram quantities of the purified peptide. We demonstrate that driving the peptides into inclusion bodies using fusion to BCL-XL-1/2 is a general strategy for their expression and isolation, as exemplified by the production of 11 peptides species.

The human innate immune system relies on the coordinated activity of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) for defense against bacterial pathogens. Yersinia spp. subvert the innate immune response to cause disease in humans. In particular, the Yersinia outer protein YopJ (Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) and YopP (Y. enterocolitica) rapidly induce apoptosis in murine macrophages and dendritic cells. However, the effects of Yersinia Yop J/P on neutrophil fate are not clearly defined. In this study, we utilized wild-type and mutant strains of Yersinia to test the contribution of YopJ and YopP on induction of apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and neutrophils. Whereas YopJ and YopP similarly induced apoptosis in HMDMs, interaction of human neutrophils with virulence plasmid-containing Yersinia did not result in PMN caspase activation, release of LDH, or loss of membrane integrity greater than PMN controls. In contrast, interaction of human PMNs with the virulence plasmid-deficient Y. pestis strain KIM6 resulted in increased surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell death. PMN reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was inhibited in a virulence plasmid-dependent but YopJ/YopP-independent manner. Following phagocytic interaction with Y. pestis strain KIM6, inhibition of PMN ROS production with diphenyleneiodonium chloride resulted in a reduction of PMN cell death similar to that induced by the virulence plasmid-containing strain Y. pestis KIM5. Our findings showed that Yersinia YopJ and/or YopP did not induce pronounced apoptosis in human neutrophils. Furthermore, robust PMN ROS production in response to virulence plasmid-deficient Yersinia was associated with increased PMN cell death, suggesting that Yersinia inhibition of PMN ROS production plays a role in evasion of the human innate immune response in part by limiting PMN apoptosis.

of a probiotic fermented milk beverage containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota on defecation frequency, intestinal microbiota, and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft stools. The effects of drinking a fermented milk beverage that contains Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) at 40 billion bacterial cells/bottle for 4 weeks (probiotics, 1 bottle/day) on defecation frequency, intestinal microbiota and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft stools were evaluated. Thirty-four healthy adults who had soft stools were randomised into 2 groups, and the effects of a regular 4-week intake of probiotics were evaluated by a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparative design. Defecation frequency significantly decreased after the 4-week intake period compared with before the probiotic treatment. The stool quality significantly improved (hardened) compared to the placebo. Also, the water content of the stools was lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group. Live LcS was recovered at 6.9 ± 1.3 and 7.2 ± 0.8 log(10) CFU per 1g of stool after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, of probiotic treatment. The number of bifidobacteria in the stools also increased significantly compared with the level before starting the probiotics. The organic acid levels (total, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) significantly increased compared with the level before intake in both the probiotic and placebo groups, but they returned to the original levels after the end of the intake period. These results suggest that probiotic fermented milk beverage has an intestine-conditioning effect by improving the frequency of defecation and stool quality and increasing the intrinsic bifidobacteria in healthy individuals with soft stool.

venereum presenting as perianal ulceration: an emerging clinical presentation? An outbreak of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) infection has been recognised in the UK since 2004, predominantly affecting HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Patients typically present with proctitis symptoms. The prevalence of rectal LGV in MSM attending sexually transmitted infection clinics in London is estimated at 1%. Health Protection Agency surveillance has shown a decrease in anorectal manifestations despite little demographic change. Two cases of HIV-infected patients presenting with isolated perianal ulcer disease are reported here. Both cases were confirmed to have rectal Chlamydia trachomatis-specific DNA of an LGV associated serovar. As presentations of LGV diversify, further education and surveillance are needed in order to reduce transmission and prevent long-term complications. A strong argument already exists for the incorporation of chlamydia nucleic acid amplification tests in the management of MSM with proctitis; this paper provides evidence that this should be extended to MSM with perianal ulcer disease.

The gene product Rv3168, a putative aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH), from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method in the presence of 0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 20% PEG 3000 at 295 K.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common sexually transmitted pathogen and is associated with infant pneumonia. Data from the female mouse model of genital tract chlamydia infection suggests a requirement for TLR2-dependent signaling in the induction of inflammation and oviduct pathology. We hypothesized that the role of TLR2 in moderating mucosal inflammation is site specific. In order to investigate this, we infected mice via the intranasal route with C. muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation, mice had more severe disease, higher lung cytokine levels, and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs. This could not be explained by impaired bacterial clearance as TLR2-deficient mice cleared the infection similar to controls. These data suggest that TLR2 has an anti-inflammatory function in the lung during Chlamydia infection, and that the role of TLR2 in mucosal inflammation varies at different mucosal surfaces.

transport in the genus Marinobacter. Marinobacter belong to the class of Gammaproteobacteria and these motile, halophilic or halotolerent bacteria are widely distributed throughout the world's oceans having been isolated from a wide variety of marine environments. They have also been identified as members of the bacterial flora associated with other marine organisms. Here, using a combination of natural products chemistry and genomic analysis, we assess the nature of the siderophores produced by this genus and their potential relationship to phylogeny and lifestyle/ecological niche of this diverse group of organisms. Our analysis shows a wide level of diversity in siderophore based iron uptake systems among this genus with three general strategies: (1) production and utilization of native siderophores in addition to utilization of a variety of exogenous ones, (2) production and utilization of native siderophores only, (3) lack of siderophore production but utilization of exogenous ones. They all share the presence of at least one siderophore-independent iron uptake ABC transport systems of the FbpABC iron metal type and lack the ability for direct transport of ferrous iron. Siderophore production and utilization can be correlated with phylogeny and thus it forms a type of chemotaxonomic marker for this genus.

A ribosomal P1 protein, Pen b 26 from Penicillium brevicompactum, was previously identified as a major allergen. A homolog protein was isolated and characterized from Penicillium crustosum which is not known to be allergenic mold. A cDNA library of P. crustosum was constructed and screened using a probe based on the DNA sequence of Pen b 26. A positive clone was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by comparing its immunological and physical properties to Pen b 26. It was designated as Pen cr 26 and had a 321 nt ORF corresponding to 107 amino acids with a MW of 11 kDa. Pen cr 26 had strong sequence homology to Pen b 26 (92% for nucleotides and 86% for amino acids) and its physical and predicted structural properties were similar to the latter. The level of expression of Pen cr 26 was much lower than that of Pen b 26 in the same expression vector. Both proteins were recognized equally well by the IgG class specific antibodies, but Pen cr 26 was poorly recognized by Penicillium-sensitive atopic sera (IgE), suggesting striking antigenic difference in IgE epitopes, i.e., 87% were positive for Pen b 26 while only 23% were positive for Pen cr 26. The allergenicity of Pen cr 26 seems to be minor in nature and it could be a hypoallergenic variant of Pen b 26.

Our previous study demonstrated that treatment of Coxiella burnetii with the phase I lipopolysaccharide (PI-LPS)-targeted monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1E4 significantly inhibited C. burnetii infection in mice, suggesting that 1E4 is a protective MAb. To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies (Abs) can provide protection against C. burnetii natural infection, we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect SCID mice against C. burnetii aerosol infection. The results indicated that 1E4 conferred significant protection against aerosolized C. burnetii, suggesting that 1E4 may be useful for preventing C. burnetii natural infection. To further understand the mechanisms of 1E4-mediated protection and to test the possibility of using humanized 1E4 to prevent C. burnetii infection, we examined whether the Fab fragment of 1E4 (Fab1E4), a recombinant murine single-chain variable fragment (muscFv1E4), and a humanized single-chain variable fragment (huscFv1E4) retained the ability of 1E4 to inhibit C. burnetii infection. The results indicated that Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, and huscFv1E4 were able to inhibit C. burnetii infection in mice but that their ability to inhibit C. burnetii infection was lower than that of 1E4. In addition, treatment of C. burnetii with Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, or huscFv1E4 can block C. burnetii infection of macrophages. Interestingly, treatment of C. burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce C. burnetii infectivity in human macrophages. This report provides the first evidence to demonstrate that the humanized variable fragments of an LPS-specific MAb can neutralize C. burnetii infection and appears to be a promising step toward the potential use of a humanized MAb as emergency prophylaxis against C. burnetii exposure.

of mutation patterns in GyrA and ParC genes with quinolone resistance levels in lactic acid bacteria. The quinolone resistance of 19 lactic acid bacterial strains belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Lactobacillus isolated from the natural fermented koumiss and yoghurt were investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the quinolone resistance levels and to explore the association of the resistance with the mutation patterns in gyrA and parC genes, as is currently recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Joint Expert Committee in Guidelines for Evaluation of Probiotics in Food for probiotic lactic acid bacteria drug resistance in 2001. The Oxford Cup method and double-tube dilution method were used to determine the quinolone resistance levels of the isolated strains. Generally, all of the 19 strains showed resistance towards norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin when the Oxford cup method was used, whereas the incidence was lower (to norfloxacin 89.5% and to ciprofloxacin 68.4%) when minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints (CLSI M100-S23) were tested. Furthermore, gene sequencing was conducted on gyrA and parC of topoisomerase II of these isolated strains. The genetic basis for quinolone resistance may be closely related to mutations in gyrA genes as there were 10 mutation sites in amino-acid sequences encoded by gyrA genes in 10 quinolone resistance strains and 14 mutation sites in Enterococcus durans HZ28, whereas no typical mutations were detected in parC genes.

Different lines of evidence suggest that a discrepancy between the distribution of Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pseudomallei in the environment and the distribution of the disease melioidosis is attributable, at least in part, to phenotypic differences between clinical and some environmental isolates. Two antigenically and biochemically distinct biotypes have been described, only one of which is virulent. In this study, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were extracted by the proteinase K digestion method from a total of 214 B. pseudomallei isolates, and their immunoreactivities with sera from patients with different clinical spectra and with other infections were evaluated. With the exception of4 isolates from a total of 214 tested, the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis silver-staining profiles of the LPSs from the two biotypes showed identical ladder patterns that were typical for smooth LPSs from other gram-negative bacteria. The 210 isolates with typical LPS patterns (119 Ara- clinical, 13 Ara- soil, 70 Ara+ soil, and 8 reference National Type Culture Collection strains) also exhibited similar immunoblot profiles against pooled sera from patients with melioidosis and hyperimmune mouse sera. Concordant findings were noted in the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with Ara- and Ara+ LPSs to coat the microtiter plates. The LPSs of the different B. pseudomallei biotypes appear antigenically indistinguishable. It is, therefore, unlikely that this component is related to the virulence and pathogenicity of B. pseudomallei.

of the role of Carnobacterium piscicola in spoilage of vacuum- and modified-atmosphere-packed cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C. The microflora on spoiled cold-smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and CO2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. The shelf-life of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the microflora was composed of LAB (10(6)-10(7) cfu/g) with an associate Gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g). The addition of nisin and/or a CO2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of LAB to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g, respectively. CO2-atmosphere +/- nisin inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages. The Gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp., resembling V. marinus, Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila. Irrespective of the addition of nisin and/or CO2-atmosphere, the LAB microflora was dominated by Carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of the 255 LAB isolates characterized. Whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE confirmed the Carnobacterium species identification. The spoilage potential of C. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx. 10(6) cfu/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C. The salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or CO2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu/g) of C. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. This was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of LAB and Gram-negative bacteria.

one-week, low-dose triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcer with Helicobacter pylori infection. Antimicrobial therapy is the recommended treatment for duodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The eradication of bismuth-based triple therapy with bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and amoxicillin is limited by low compliance, drug resistance and side-effects. Two-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy has a higher eradication rate but is costly. This study was designed to compare the efficacy, patient compliance and cost of short-term PPI-based triple therapy with those of bismuth-based triple therapy. Ninety patients with active duodenal ulcer disease and H pylori infection, proven with the 13C-urea breath test and CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups: Group A, DeNol 120 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days; Group B, omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days; Group C, omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Nizatidine 150 mg twice a day was given continuously following the end of anti-H pylori therapy for each group. Two months later, endoscopy, the CLO test and 13C-urea breath test were repeated to assess the eradication rate of H pylori and the ulcer-healing rate. Drug tolerance was evaluated by patients themselves by daily recording of any side-effects. Eighty-four patients completed the entire course of therapy and evaluation for H pylori infection. The H pylori eradication rates in Groups A, B and C were 75% (21/28), 93% (26/28) and 89% (25/28), respectively (p = 0.466). The ulcer healing rate was 86% (24/28) in Group A and 89% (25/28) in Groups B and C (p = 0.764). A total of 74 patients (88%) were free from symptoms at the end of the triple therapy. Symptom relief was faster in patients with PPI-based triple therapy (Groups B and C) (days 3 and 4) than for patients with bismuth-based triple therapy (day 5). The cost of Group C therapy was lower than that for Groups A and B. There were no major side-effects in any of the patients. One-week triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole is highly effected for the eradication of H pylori. A therapeutic regime of one week's duration with lower cost, good compliance and mild side-effects may offer a good choice for treatment of duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori infection in clinical practice.

the lactic acid bacterial group (LAB), Lactobacillus was seen to be present in different numbers depending of the cheese surface.  Dolci et al. (2009) detected Lactobacillus counts of 105–107 CFU/cm2 on Fontina cheese surface after 90 days of ripening and Cocolin et al. (2009)  reported that lactococci and lactobacilli, dominated the microbial  ecology of Gorgonzola rind. Our results showed that the species L. curvatus for example was only isolated from Taleggio rind and L. brevis  was isolated from the surface of Gorgonzola and Scimudin cheeses. In  particular most of the surface isolates from Formaggio di Fossa cheese  were identified as L. acidipiscis, a Gram positive rod,  microaerophilic, able to grow in 10–12% (w/v) NaCl. This species  originally isolated from fermented fish, and characterized by  Tanasupawat et al. (2000), was recently reported to be present in Greek cheese (Asteri et al., 2009). Enteroccocci were present in larger numbers on Scimudin (107 CFU/cm2) and Gorgonzola (105 CFU/cm2) surfaces than on Fontina rind (104 CFU/cm2) as reported by Dolci et al. (2009) while Cocolin et al. (2009) obtained diverse enterococci counts, with variation between 103–108 CFU/g  within the 18 samples of Gorgonzola rinds analyzed.

Our metagenomic sequencing uncovered previously undescribed mgl sequences with high sequence similarity to various γ-Proteobacteria in cheeses from both Europe and North America ( Table S4B). Several of these previously undescribed mgl sequences belonged to Pseudoalteromonas spp. ( Figures 4C and S4B). We mapped metagenomic reads from three cheeses in which Pseudoalteromonas was abundant to the reference genome of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (99.5% pairwise identity,  Table S4C). Additionally, Pseudoalteromonas is known to have many cold-adapted enzymes that function in the polar seawater where this bacterium typically grows ( Médigue et al., 2005).

At the first time point, the community consisted primarily of Proteobacteria, the bacterium Leuconostoc, and the yeast Candida, which can be found at low levels in raw milk ( Quigley et al., 2013). Whereas Candida persisted in the fungal portion of the community, the Proteobacteria were succeeded by Staphylococcus within the first 7 days. As the rinds matured, bacterial taxa Brevibacterium and Brachybacterium and fungal taxa Penicillium and Scopulariopsis  emerged consistently as a significant fraction of the community (on  average, >1% in mature cheeses). Principal coordinate analysis shows a  reproducible trajectory of all three communities over time ( Figure 7B),  with the most rapid changes in composition occurring at early time  points, which is consistent with previous observations of primary  succession ( Fierer et al., 2012 and Shade et al., 2013).
