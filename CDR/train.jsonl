In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors.

Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol\/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight Crohn's disease patients were included. Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated."],"offsets":[[120,1542]]}],"entities":[{"id":"215","type":"Disease","text":["Crohn's disease"],"offsets":[[13,28]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003424"}]},{"id":"216","type":"Chemical","text":["fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[34,46]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"217","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclosporin"],"offsets":[[107,118]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016572"}]},{"id":"218","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclosporin"],"offsets":[[217,228]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016572"}]},{"id":"219","type":"Disease","text":["Crohn's disease"],"offsets":[[292,307]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003424"}]},{"id":"220","type":"Chemical","text":["fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[391,403]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"221","type":"Disease","text":["Crohn's disease"],"offsets":[[467,482]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003424"}]},{"id":"222","type":"Chemical","text":["Fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[507,519]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"223","type":"Chemical","text":["fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[743,755]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"224","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[910,916]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"225","type":"Chemical","text":["fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[1205,1217]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"226","type":"Disease","text":["Crohn's disease"],"offsets":[[1263,1278]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003424"}]},{"id":"227","type":"Chemical","text":["fusidic acid"],"offsets":[[1402,1414]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005672"}]},{"id":"228","type":"Disease","text":["inflammatory bowel disease"],"offsets":[[1440,1466]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015212"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"229","type":"CID","arg1_id":"216","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]},{"id":"230","type":"CID","arg1_id":"220","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]},{"id":"231","type":"CID","arg1_id":"222","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]},{"id":"232","type":"CID","arg1_id":"223","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]},{"id":"233","type":"CID","arg1_id":"225","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]},{"id":"234","type":"CID","arg1_id":"227","arg2_id":"224","normalized":[]}]}

The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone. It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin).

Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg\/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment."],"offsets":[[119,1328]]}],"entities":[{"id":"654","type":"Chemical","text":["carbamazepine"],"offsets":[[8,21]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"655","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[54,62]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"656","type":"Chemical","text":["folate"],"offsets":[[96,102]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005492"}]},{"id":"657","type":"Chemical","text":["Folate"],"offsets":[[119,125]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005492"}]},{"id":"658","type":"Chemical","text":["Carbamazepine"],"offsets":[[206,219]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"659","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[221,224]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"660","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[354,357]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"661","type":"Chemical","text":["folate"],"offsets":[[371,377]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005492"}]},{"id":"662","type":"Chemical","text":["propylene glycol"],"offsets":[[463,479]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D019946"}]},{"id":"663","type":"Disease","text":["seizures"],"offsets":[[565,573]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"664","type":"Disease","text":["weight gain"],"offsets":[[588,599]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015430"}]},{"id":"665","type":"Disease","text":["Seizures"],"offsets":[[601,609]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"666","type":"Chemical","text":["hexafluorodiethyl ether"],"offsets":[[621,644]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005481"}]},{"id":"667","type":"Chemical","text":["HFDE"],"offsets":[[646,650]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005481"}]},{"id":"668","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[716,719]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"669","type":"Disease","text":["seizures"],"offsets":[[725,733]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"670","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[796,799]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"671","type":"Chemical","text":["HFDE"],"offsets":[[894,898]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005481"}]},{"id":"672","type":"Disease","text":["seizures"],"offsets":[[907,915]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"673","type":"Disease","text":["weight gain"],"offsets":[[955,966]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015430"}]},{"id":"674","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[998,1001]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"675","type":"Chemical","text":["CBZ"],"offsets":[[1134,1137]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002220"}]},{"id":"676","type":"Chemical","text":["folate"],"offsets":[[1172,1178]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005492"}]},{"id":"677","type":"Chemical","text":["folate"],"offsets":[[1223,1229]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005492"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"678","type":"CID","arg1_id":"666","arg2_id":"663","normalized":[]},{"id":"679","type":"CID","arg1_id":"666","arg2_id":"665","normalized":[]},{"id":"680","type":"CID","arg1_id":"666","arg2_id":"669","normalized":[]},{"id":"681","type":"CID","arg1_id":"666","arg2_id":"672","normalized":[]},{"id":"682","type":"CID","arg1_id":"667","arg2_id":"663","normalized":[]},{"id":"683","type":"CID","arg1_id":"667","arg2_id":"665","normalized":[]},{"id":"684","type":"CID","arg1_id":"667","arg2_id":"669","normalized":[]},{"id":"685","type":"CID","arg1_id":"667","arg2_id":"672","normalized":[]},{"id":"686","type":"CID","arg1_id":"671","arg2_id":"663","normalized":[]},{"id":"687","type":"CID","arg1_id":"671","arg2_id":"665","normalized":[]},{"id":"688","type":"CID","arg1_id":"671","arg2_id":"669","normalized":[]},{"id":"689","type":"CID","arg1_id":"671","arg2_id":"672","normalized":[]}]}

Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"],"offsets":[[62,1842]]}],"entities":[{"id":"707","type":"Disease","text":["Death"],"offsets":[[0,5]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003643"}]},{"id":"708","type":"Disease","text":["gestational trophoblastic disease"],"offsets":[[27,60]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D031901"}]},{"id":"709","type":"Disease","text":["choriocarcinoma"],"offsets":[[175,190]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002822"}]},{"id":"710","type":"Chemical","text":["Etoposide"],"offsets":[[399,408]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005047"}]},{"id":"711","type":"Chemical","text":["Methotrexate"],"offsets":[[417,429]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008727"}]},{"id":"712","type":"Chemical","text":["Cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[431,447]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"713","type":"Chemical","text":["Actomycin-D"],"offsets":[[449,460]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003609"}]},{"id":"714","type":"Chemical","text":["Cisplatin"],"offsets":[[466,475]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002945"}]},{"id":"715","type":"Chemical","text":["Methotrexate"],"offsets":[[534,546]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008727"}]},{"id":"716","type":"Chemical","text":["Etoposide"],"offsets":[[548,557]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005047"}]},{"id":"717","type":"Chemical","text":["Cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[562,578]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"718","type":"Disease","text":["pulmonary obstruction"],"offsets":[[701,722]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011655"}]},{"id":"719","type":"Disease","text":["tumor"],"offsets":[[854,859]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009369"}]},{"id":"720","type":"Disease","text":["necrosis"],"offsets":[[860,868]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009336"}]},{"id":"721","type":"Disease","text":["tumor"],"offsets":[[961,966]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009369"}]},{"id":"722","type":"Disease","text":["tumor"],"offsets":[[1009,1014]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009369"}]},{"id":"723","type":"Disease","text":["tumor"],"offsets":[[1107,1112]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009369"}]},{"id":"724","type":"Disease","text":["embolism"],"offsets":[[1224,1232]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004617"}]},{"id":"725","type":"Disease","text":["necrosis"],"offsets":[[1273,1281]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009336"}]},{"id":"726","type":"Disease","text":["pelvic tumor"],"offsets":[[1335,1347]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010386"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"727","type":"CID","arg1_id":"710","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]},{"id":"728","type":"CID","arg1_id":"716","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]},{"id":"729","type":"CID","arg1_id":"711","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]},{"id":"730","type":"CID","arg1_id":"715","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]},{"id":"731","type":"CID","arg1_id":"712","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]},{"id":"732","type":"CID","arg1_id":"717","arg2_id":"718","normalized":[]}]}

Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg\/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and\/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS\/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg\/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS\/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS\/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated

Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever, we concluded that vitamin D3 cannot be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum."],"offsets":[[35,1205]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1280","type":"Chemical","text":["Vitamin

As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies (46 +\/- 19% vs 34 +\/- 10%), it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se.

The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis, presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade. However, coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick. Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 3%, and 6% and 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose-dependent manner. All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0.75%. The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes. No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate-treated chicks. There was a statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound. Control chicks were in motion an average of 33.67% of the time, while coniine-treated chicks were only moving 8.95% of a 5-min interval, and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks. In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine-induced arthrogryposis.

movement."],"offsets":[[50,1743]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1771","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[10,17]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1772","type":"Chemical","text":["Coniine"],"offsets":[[50,57]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1773","type":"Disease","text":["arthrogryposis"],"offsets":[[191,205]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001176"}]},{"id":"1774","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[263,270]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1775","type":"Disease","text":["arthrogryposis"],"offsets":[[293,307]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001176"}]},{"id":"1776","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[436,443]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1777","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[448,456]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"1778","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[500,507]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1779","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[512,520]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"1780","type":"Disease","text":["deformations"],"offsets":[[645,657]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009140"}]},{"id":"1781","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[722,730]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"1782","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[787,794]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1783","type":"Disease","text":["deformations"],"offsets":[[820,832]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009140"}]},{"id":"1784","type":"Chemical","text":["coniine"],"offsets":[[848,855]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C007112"}]},{"id":"1785","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[860,868]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"1786","type":"Disease","text":["excessive

Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >\/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg\/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg\/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >\/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC."],"offsets":[[161,2619]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2131","type":"Chemical","text":["Gemcitabine"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C056507"}]},{"id":"2132","type":"Chemical","text":["vinorelbine"],"offsets":[[17,28]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C030852"}]},{"id":"2133","type":"Disease","text":["nonsmall

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g\/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites."],"offsets":[[78,3538]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2228","type":"Chemical","text":["Warfarin"],"offsets":[[0,8]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014859"}]},{"id":"2229","type":"Disease","text":["artery

METHOD: The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale. Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV bipolar I vs. bipolar II), number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), use and type of mood stabilizers (lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview. RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [8\/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes. Sex, age, diagnosis (bipolar I vs. bipolar II), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching. The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer. In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium (15%, 4\/26) than in patients not treated with lithium (44%, 8\/18; p = .04). The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008). CONCLUSION: The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches."],"offsets":[[82,2241]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2579","type":"Chemical","text":["Antidepressant"],"offsets":[[0,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"2580","type":"Disease","text":["mania"],"offsets":[[23,28]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001714"}]},{"id":"2581","type":"Disease","text":["bipolar"],"offsets":[[32,39]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001714"}]},{"id":"2582","type":"Disease","text":["mania"],"offsets":[[140,145]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001714"}]},{"id":"2583","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressants"],"offsets":[[162,177]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"2584","type":"Disease","text":["bipolar

To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag\/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB\/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +\/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort.

We investigated this association, according to the type of progestagen included in third-generation (i.e., desogestrel or gestodene) and second-generation (i.e., levonorgestrel) oral contraceptives, the dose of estrogen, and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence. Subjects supplied information on oral-contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors. An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive, as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8). The adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.1) among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives and 1.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 2.5) among those who used third-generation oral contraceptives. Among women who used oral contraceptives, the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second-generation oral contraceptives. The results with respect to the use of third-generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second-generation oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic

Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core, and then were locally injected with GR 55562 (an antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors) or CP 93129 (an agonist of 5-HT1B receptors). Given alone to any accumbal subregion, GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg\/side) or CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg\/side) did not change basal locomotor activity. Systemic cocaine (10 mg\/kg) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats. GR 55562 (0.1-10 microg\/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to cocaine, dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core. When injected into the accumbens shell (but not the core) before cocaine, CP 93129 (0.1-10 microg\/side) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg\/side of the agonist. The later enhancement was attenuated after intra-accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 (1 microg\/side). Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell, but not core, this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (GR 55562) and agonist (CP 93129), respectively.

CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period. T-cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients, but not in healthy controls. DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature. Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course, but complete remission was observed in all reported cases. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine. The mechanisms of this ticlopidine-induced cholestasis are unclear. Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug's hepatotoxicity, as suggested by the T-cell stimulation study reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated. Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts. This complication will be observed even less often in the future as ticlopidine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel."],"offsets":[[43,1745]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3009","type":"Chemical","text":["Ticlopidine"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013988"}]},{"id":"3010","type":"Disease","text":["cholestatic

The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the

3."],"offsets":[[136,1832]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3325","type":"Chemical","text":["sodium"],"offsets":[[11,17]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012964"}]},{"id":"3326","type":"Chemical","text":["puromycin

Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U-II have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of U-II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of U-II (1-10,000 ng\/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of U-II also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng\/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng\/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng\/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U-II at doses of 1-10,000 ng\/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse.

Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain. Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration. We found that (i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation. The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal.

The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors."],"offsets":[[76,1476]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3560","type":"Chemical","text":["citrate"],"offsets":[[7,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C102006"}]},{"id":"3561","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[15,23]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"3562","type":"Chemical","text":["citrate"],"offsets":[[103,110]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C102006"}]},{"id":"3563","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[111,119]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"3564","type":"Disease","text":["hypertension"],"offsets":[[287,299]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006973"}]},{"id":"3565","type":"Disease","text":["hyperlipidemia"],"offsets":[[301,315]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006949"}]},{"id":"3566","type":"Disease","text":["depression"],"offsets":[[321,331]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003866"}]},{"id":"3567","type":"Chemical","text":["bumetanide"],"offsets":[[363,373]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002034"}]},{"id":"3568","type":"Chemical","text":["pravastatin"],"offsets":[[375,386]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017035"}]},{"id":"3569","type":"Chemical","text":["paroxetine"],"offsets":[[392,402]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017374"}]},{"id":"3570","type":"Disease","text":["tetany"],"offsets":[[587,593]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013746"}]},{"id":"3571","type":"Chemical","text":["calcium gluconate"],"offsets":[[632,649]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002125"}]},{"id":"3572","type":"Disease","text":["muscle contractions"],"offsets":[[669,688]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C536214"}]},{"id":"3573","type":"Chemical","text":["calcium"],"offsets":[[794,801]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002118"}]},{"id":"3574","type":"Chemical","text":["sodium citrate"],"offsets":[[815,829]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C102006"}]},{"id":"3575","type":"Disease","text":["hypocalcemia"],"offsets":[[878,890]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006996"}]},{"id":"3576","type":"Chemical","text":["bumetanide"],"offsets":[[950,960]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002034"}]},{"id":"3577","type":"Chemical","text":["loop diuretic"],"offsets":[[966,979]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D049994"}]},{"id":"3578","type":"Disease","text":["hypocalcemia"],"offsets":[[1007,1019]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006996"}]},{"id":"3579","type":"Disease","text":["hypocalcemia"],"offsets":[[1114,1126]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006996"}]},{"id":"3580","type":"Chemical","text":["citrate"],"offsets":[[1182,1189]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C102006"}]},{"id":"3581","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[1190,1198]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"3582","type":"Chemical","text":["calcium"],"offsets":[[1246,1253]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002118"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"3583","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3560","arg2_id":"3575","normalized":[]},{"id":"3584","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3560","arg2_id":"3578","normalized":[]},{"id":"3585","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3560","arg2_id":"3579","normalized":[]},{"id":"3586","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3562","arg2_id":"3575","normalized":[]},{"id":"3587","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3562","arg2_id":"3578","normalized":[]},{"id":"3588","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3562","arg2_id":"3579","normalized":[]},{"id":"3589","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3574","arg2_id":"3575","normalized":[]},{"id":"3590","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3574","arg2_id":"3578","normalized":[]},{"id":"3591","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3574","arg2_id":"3579","normalized":[]},{"id":"3592","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3580","arg2_id":"3575","normalized":[]},{"id":"3593","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3580","arg2_id":"3578","normalized":[]},{"id":"3594","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3580","arg2_id":"3579","normalized":[]}]}

More recently, proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear. We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion. The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy, due to chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) (n = 15) neoplasia (n = 8); Kaposi's sarcoma, Four skin cancers, One intestinal tumors, One renal cell carsinom) or BK virus nephropathy (n = 2). SRL was started at a mean of 78 +\/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation. Mean follow-up on SRL therapy was 20 +\/- 12 (6 to 43) months. Proteinuria increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g\/d before conversion to 3.2 g\/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001). Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no proteinuria, whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria. In 28% of patients proteinuria remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients. In 40% it increased by more than 100%. Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range. Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis. These patients showed persistently good graft function. Serum creatinine values did not change significantly: 1.98 +\/- 0.8 mg\/dL before SRL therapy and 2.53 +\/- 1.9 mg\/dL at last follow-up (P = .14). Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis. Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi's sarcoma. Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1.26 (0.5 to 3.5) g\/d before and 4.7 (3 to 12) g\/d after conversion (P = .01). Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2.21 mg\/dL and thereafter, 4.93 mg\/dL (P = .02). Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation.

Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)\/M(3)\/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased."],"offsets":[[120,2189]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3748","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[74,90]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"3749","type":"Disease","text":["cystitis"],"offsets":[[99,107]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003556"}]},{"id":"3750","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[123,139]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"3751","type":"Disease","text":["cystitis"],"offsets":[[148,156]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003556"}]},{"id":"3752","type":"Disease","text":["cystitis"],"offsets":[[323,331]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003556"}]},{"id":"3753","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[417,433]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"3754","type":"Chemical","text":["atropine"],"offsets":[[614,622]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001285"}]},{"id":"3755","type":"Chemical","text":["alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate"],"offsets":[[830,876]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C002630"}]},{"id":"3756","type":"Chemical","text":["alpha,beta-meATP"],"offsets":[[878,894]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C002630"}]},{"id":"3757","type":"Chemical","text":["atropine"],"offsets":[[987,995]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001285"}]},{"id":"3758","type":"Chemical","text":["4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine"],"offsets":[[997,1033]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C042375"}]},{"id":"3759","type":"Chemical","text":["4-DAMP"],"offsets":[[1035,1041]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C042375"}]},{"id":"3760","type":"Chemical","text":["methoctramine"],"offsets":[[1073,1086]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C054938"}]},{"id":"3761","type":"Chemical","text":["pirenzepine"],"offsets":[[1110,1121]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010890"}]},{"id":"3762","type":"Chemical","text":["4-DAMP"],"offsets":[[1278,1284]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C042375"}]},{"id":"3763","type":"Chemical","text":["methoctramine"],"offsets":[[1349,1362]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C054938"}]},{"id":"3764","type":"Chemical","text":["pirenzepine"],"offsets":[[1367,1378]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010890"}]},{"id":"3765","type":"Chemical","text":["pirenzepine"],"offsets":[[1542,1553]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010890"}]},{"id":"3766","type":"Chemical","text":["4-DAMP"],"offsets":[[1558,1564]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C042375"}]},{"id":"3767","type":"Chemical","text":["methoctramine"],"offsets":[[1666,1679]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C054938"}]},{"id":"3768","type":"Chemical","text":["carbachol"],"offsets":[[1780,1789]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002217"}]},{"id":"3769","type":"Chemical","text":["ATP"],"offsets":[[1794,1797]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000255"}]},{"id":"3770","type":"Chemical","text":["potassium"],"offsets":[[1874,1883]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011188"}]},{"id":"3771","type":"Chemical","text":["isoprenaline"],"offsets":[[1894,1906]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007545"}]},{"id":"3772","type":"Disease","text":["cystitis"],"offsets":[[1969,1977]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003556"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"3773","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3748","arg2_id":"3749","normalized":[]},{"id":"3774","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3748","arg2_id":"3751","normalized":[]},{"id":"3775","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3748","arg2_id":"3752","normalized":[]},{"id":"3776","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3748","arg2_id":"3772","normalized":[]},{"id":"3777","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3750","arg2_id":"3749","normalized":[]},{"id":"3778","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3750","arg2_id":"3751","normalized":[]},{"id":"3779","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3750","arg2_id":"3752","normalized":[]},{"id":"3780","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3750","arg2_id":"3772","normalized":[]},{"id":"3781","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3753","arg2_id":"3749","normalized":[]},{"id":"3782","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3753","arg2_id":"3751","normalized":[]},{"id":"3783","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3753","arg2_id":"3752","normalized":[]},{"id":"3784","type":"CID","arg1_id":"3753","arg2_id":"3772","normalized":[]}]}

METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +\/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +\/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs\/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs\/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD\/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +\/- SD duration of BZD\/RD use was 7 +\/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs\/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs\/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs\/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs\/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables.

For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia (<150 x 10(9)\/L) after exposure to heparin, who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin] were included in the study. RESULTS: Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis; 54\/94 had isolated-HIT without thrombosis. Eight of the isolated-HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d; thus, a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30. At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated-HIT. However, OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis (n = 48, 1.34 +\/- 0.89), including isolated-HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d (n = 8, 1.84 +\/- 0.64) as compared to isolated-HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis (0.96 +\/- 0.75; P = 0.011 and P = 0.008). The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD >1.27 in the isolated-HIT group had a significantly higher chance of developing thrombosis by day 30. None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition. Multivariate analysis showed a 2.8-fold increased risk of thrombosis in females.

DESIGN: Case study. SETTING: Ophthalmology clinic of an academic hospital. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old woman referred from the infertility clinic for blurred vision. INTERVENTION(S): Ophthalmic examination after CC therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Central retinal vein occlusion after ovulation induction with CC. RESULT(S): A 36-year-old Chinese woman developed central retinal vein occlusion after eight courses of CC. A search of the literature on the thromboembolic complications of CC does not include this severe ophthalmic complication, although mild visual disturbance after CC intake is not uncommon.

The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell histamine release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin D2 and cholesterol. Additionally, the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml\/kg of corn oil containing vitamin D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis. Control rats received corn oil only. After gastric surgery, rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline. Gastric acid back-diffusion, mucosal LPO generation, histamine concentration, microvascular permeability, luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined. Elevated atherosclerotic parameters, such as serum calcium, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats. Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors, including gastric acid back-diffusion, histamine release, LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats. Moreover, a positive correlation of histamine to gastric hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats. This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose-dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil.

verapamil in

The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin. Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway."],"offsets":[[107,1695]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4341","type":"Chemical","text":["Adriamycin"],"offsets":[[0,10]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4342","type":"Disease","text":["death"],"offsets":[[44,49]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003643"}]},{"id":"4343","type":"Disease","text":["heart

Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published. We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction. METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic acid. RESULTS: 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic acid: 153 women and 119 men. Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic acid exposure (39.7%). It was \"serious\" for almost 2\/3 of the patients (62.5%) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases (82%). The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years. CONCLUSION: This work shows that confusion with valproic acid is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction. It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment."],"offsets":[[121,1158]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4439","type":"Disease","text":["Confusion"],"offsets":[[0,9]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4440","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[55,68]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]},{"id":"4441","type":"Disease","text":["Confusion"],"offsets":[[135,144]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4442","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[198,211]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]},{"id":"4443","type":"Disease","text":["confusion"],"offsets":[[513,522]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4444","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[548,561]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]},{"id":"4445","type":"Disease","text":["confusion"],"offsets":[[585,594]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4446","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[614,627]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]},{"id":"4447","type":"Disease","text":["Confusion"],"offsets":[[652,661]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4448","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[715,728]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]},{"id":"4449","type":"Disease","text":["confusion"],"offsets":[[978,987]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"4450","type":"Chemical","text":["valproic acid"],"offsets":[[993,1006]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014635"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"4451","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4452","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4453","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4454","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4455","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4456","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4440","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]},{"id":"4457","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4458","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4459","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4460","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4461","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4462","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4442","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]},{"id":"4463","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4464","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4465","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4466","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4467","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4468","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4444","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]},{"id":"4469","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4470","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4471","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4472","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4473","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4474","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4446","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]},{"id":"4475","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4476","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4477","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4478","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4479","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4480","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4448","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]},{"id":"4481","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4439","normalized":[]},{"id":"4482","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4441","normalized":[]},{"id":"4483","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4443","normalized":[]},{"id":"4484","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4445","normalized":[]},{"id":"4485","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4447","normalized":[]},{"id":"4486","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4450","arg2_id":"4449","normalized":[]}]}

In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and\/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use.

ecstasy."],"offsets":[[103,1891]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4490","type":"Disease","text":["Learning and memory

In the following report, a 65-year-old critically ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation. The patient required massive transfusion support (55 units of red blood cells, 42 units of fresh-frozen plasma, 40 units of cryoprecipitate, 40 units of platelets, and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa) for severe intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for argatroban concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time (ECT) assay. RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg\/mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life (t(1\/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1\/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with hepatic impairment]). CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient's extended coagulopathy. Because DTIs do not have reversal agents, surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents. This is the first report to measure plasma argatroban concentration in the context of CPB and extended coagulopathy."],"offsets":[[151,1849]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4667","type":"Chemical","text":["argatroban"],"offsets":[[30,40]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C031942"}]},{"id":"4668","type":"Chemical","text":["heparin"],"offsets":[[101,108]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006493"}]},{"id":"4669","type":"Disease","text":["thrombocytopenia"],"offsets":[[117,133]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"4670","type":"Disease","text":["thrombosis"],"offsets":[[139,149]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013927"}]},{"id":"4671","type":"Chemical","text":["heparin"],"offsets":[[277,284]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006493"}]},{"id":"4672","type":"Disease","text":["thrombocytopenia"],"offsets":[[293,309]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"4673","type":"Disease","text":["HIT"],"offsets":[[311,314]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"4674","type":"Disease","text":["HIT"],"offsets":[[319,322]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"4675","type":"Disease","text":["thrombosis"],"offsets":[[328,338]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013927"}]},{"id":"4676","type":"Disease","text":["HITT"],"offsets":[[340,344]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"},{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013927"}]},{"id":"4677","type":"Disease","text":["critically

Prospective studies on ATT-ALF are lacking. The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude, clinical course, outcome, and prognostic factors in ATT-ALF. From January 1986 to January 2009, 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated: ATT alone was the cause in 70 (5.7%) patients. Another 15 (1.2%) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection. In 44 (62.8%) patients, ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis. ATT-ALF patients were younger (32.87 [+\/-15.8] years), and 49 (70%) of them were women. Most had hyperacute presentation; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4.5 (0-30) days. The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 (7-350) days. At presentation, advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 (76%) and 29 (41.4%) patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal bleed, seizures, infection, and acute renal failure were documented in seven (10%), five (7.1%), 26 (37.1%), and seven (10%) patients, respectively. Compared with hepatitis E virus (HEV) and non-A non-E-induced ALF, ATT-ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes. The mortality rate among patients with ATT-ALF was high (67.1%, n = 47), and only 23 (32.9%) patients recovered with medical treatment. In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin (>or=10.8 mg\/dL), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade III\/IV encephalopathy at presentation. CONCLUSION: ATT-ALF constituted 5.7% of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate. Because the mortality rate is so high, determining which factors are predictors is less important.

prevented."],"offsets":[[112,2030]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4727","type":"Chemical","text":["Antituberculosis"],"offsets":[[0,16]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000995"}]},{"id":"4728","type":"Disease","text":["acute

WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain better insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as patients with advanced age, renal and kidney disease. We also explore different dosing and schedules of capecitabine administration. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and was developed to fulfill the need for a more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety\/efficacy profile. It has shown promising results alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in colorectal, breast, pancreaticobiliary, gastric, renal cell and head and neck cancers. The most commonly reported toxic effects of capecitabine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome.

Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin.

Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS\/QT.

In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine-induced increase in rate-pressure product. In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction, coronary occlusion may be due to spasm, thrombus, or both. With regard to spasm, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative. Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction. Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete infarction. Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite. The finding of cocaine-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects.

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules. Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance.

Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +\/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +\/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +\/- 8.4 and 10.1 +\/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02).

A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of saralasin (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II) throughout the experimental period. In each group, SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr. During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin-treated animals showed no change. Following discontinuation of SNP, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin-treated rats. This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post-SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin.

METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N  omercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd  ne) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers.

Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with ampicillin was positive. DISCUSSION: After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out, a drug-induced allergic reaction was suspected.

A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin (AX) or were cross-reacting with other penicillin derivatives. Skin tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl-poly-L-lysine (BPO-PLL), benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenicillin (PG), ampicillin (AMP), and AX. RAST for BPO-PLL and AX-PLL was done. When both skin test and RAST for BPO were negative, single-blind, placebo-controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of PG or sensitivity to AX. A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG. Anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients (69%), the other 17 (31%) having urticaria and\/or angioedema. All the patients were skin test negative to BPO; 49 of 51 (96%) were also negative to MDM, and 44 of 46 (96%) to PG. Skin tests with AX were positive in 34 (63%) patients. RAST was positive for AX in 22 patients (41%) and to BPO in just 5 (9%). None of the sera with negative RAST for AX were positive to BPO. Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to AX, and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative. PG was well tolerated by all 54 patients. We describe the largest group of AX-allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far. Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific AX-related reagents are employed.

We report a case of atracurium-related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids."],"offsets":[[90,767]]}],"entities":[{"id":"6402","type":"Disease","text":["paralysis"],"offsets":[[11,20]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010243"}]},{"id":"6403","type":"Chemical","text":["atracurium"],"offsets":[[44,54]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001279"}]},{"id":"6404","type":"Disease","text":["paralysis"],"offsets":[[222,231]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010243"}]},{"id":"6405","type":"Chemical","text":["vecuronium bromide"],"offsets":[[330,348]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014673"}]},{"id":"6406","type":"Chemical","text":["Atracurium besylate"],"offsets":[[408,427]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001279"}]},{"id":"6407","type":"Chemical","text":["benzylisoquinolinium"],"offsets":[[444,464]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"6408","type":"Disease","text":["paralysis"],"offsets":[[574,583]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010243"}]},{"id":"6409","type":"Chemical","text":["atracurium"],"offsets":[[646,656]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001279"}]},{"id":"6410","type":"Disease","text":["paralysis"],"offsets":[[665,674]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010243"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"6411","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6403","arg2_id":"6402","normalized":[]},{"id":"6412","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6403","arg2_id":"6404","normalized":[]},{"id":"6413","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6403","arg2_id":"6408","normalized":[]},{"id":"6414","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6403","arg2_id":"6410","normalized":[]},{"id":"6415","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6406","arg2_id":"6402","normalized":[]},{"id":"6416","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6406","arg2_id":"6404","normalized":[]},{"id":"6417","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6406","arg2_id":"6408","normalized":[]},{"id":"6418","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6406","arg2_id":"6410","normalized":[]},{"id":"6419","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6409","arg2_id":"6402","normalized":[]},{"id":"6420","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6409","arg2_id":"6404","normalized":[]},{"id":"6421","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6409","arg2_id":"6408","normalized":[]},{"id":"6422","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6409","arg2_id":"6410","normalized":[]},{"id":"6423","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6405","arg2_id":"6402","normalized":[]},{"id":"6424","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6405","arg2_id":"6404","normalized":[]},{"id":"6425","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6405","arg2_id":"6408","normalized":[]},{"id":"6426","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6405","arg2_id":"6410","normalized":[]}]}

As a result of these and other studies, phenacetin has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries. However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and ESRD, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4. These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former. This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves. A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone. Thus, acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations.

Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The majority of anionic sites (74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively). Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg\/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg\/24 h, p<0.002). At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed.

Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients.

Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks. Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites, with lung metastasis predominant. Seven patients had been treated with anthracycline. Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy. Median number of courses of MFL regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68.35 mg\/m2. One patient had complete response, seven had stable disease, none had partial response and five had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate was 7.6%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. Median survival was 16 months. Median progression-free survival was 5 months. A complete responder had relapse-free survival up to 17 months. Major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leukopenia. Eight patients were dead in the last follow-up; two of them died of treatment-related toxicity. The MFL regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate. Administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention."],"offsets":[[205,1898]]}],"entities":[{"id":"6696","type":"Disease","text":["breast cancer"],"offsets":[[43,56]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001943"}]},{"id":"6697","type":"Chemical","text":["mitoxantrone"],"offsets":[[60,72]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008942"}]},{"id":"6698","type":"Chemical","text":["5-FU"],"offsets":[[118,122]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005472"}]},{"id":"6699","type":"Chemical","text":["leucovorin"],"offsets":[[127,137]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002955"}]},{"id":"6700","type":"Chemical","text":["MFL"],"offsets":[[139,142]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C085788"}]},{"id":"6701","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[195,203]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"6702","type":"Disease","text":["breast cancer"],"offsets":[[237,250]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001943"}]},{"id":"6703","type":"Chemical","text":["mitoxantrone"],"offsets":[[324,336]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008942"}]},{"id":"6704","type":"Chemical","text":["5-fluorouracil"],"offsets":[[348,362]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005472"}]},{"id":"6705","type":"Chemical","text":["5-FU"],"offsets":[[364,368]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005472"}]},{"id":"6706","type":"Chemical","text":["leucovorin"],"offsets":[[374,384]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002955"}]},{"id":"6707","type":"Chemical","text":["MFL regimen"],"offsets":[[386,397]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C085788"}]},{"id":"6708","type":"Disease","text":["breast cancer"],"offsets":[[568,581]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001943"}]},{"id":"6709","type":"Chemical","text":["mitoxantrone"],"offsets":[[585,597]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008942"}]},{"id":"6710","type":"Chemical","text":["5-FU"],"offsets":[[645,649]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005472"}]},{"id":"6711","type":"Chemical","text":["leucovorin"],"offsets":[[677,687]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002955"}]},{"id":"6712","type":"Chemical","text":["anthracycline"],"offsets":[[909,922]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018943"}]},{"id":"6713","type":"Chemical","text":["MFL regimen"],"offsets":[[1044,1055]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C085788"}]},{"id":"6714","type":"Chemical","text":["mitoxantrone"],"offsets":[[1104,1116]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008942"}]},{"id":"6715","type":"Disease","text":["toxicities"],"offsets":[[1492,1502]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"6716","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[1508,1522]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"6717","type":"Disease","text":["leukopenia"],"offsets":[[1527,1537]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007970"}]},{"id":"6718","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[1625,1633]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"6719","type":"Chemical","text":["MFL regimen"],"offsets":[[1639,1650]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C085788"}]},{"id":"6720","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[1705,1713]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"6721","type":"Disease","text":["breast cancer"],"offsets":[[1771,1784]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001943"}]},{"id":"6722","type":"Disease","text":["impaired heart function"],"offsets":[[1847,1870]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006331"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"6723","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6700","arg2_id":"6722","normalized":[]},{"id":"6724","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6707","arg2_id":"6722","normalized":[]},{"id":"6725","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6713","arg2_id":"6722","normalized":[]},{"id":"6726","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6719","arg2_id":"6722","normalized":[]},{"id":"6727","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6700","arg2_id":"6717","normalized":[]},{"id":"6728","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6707","arg2_id":"6717","normalized":[]},{"id":"6729","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6713","arg2_id":"6717","normalized":[]},{"id":"6730","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6719","arg2_id":"6717","normalized":[]}]}

Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function."],"offsets":[[116,1855]]}],"entities":[{"id":"6852","type":"Chemical","text":["tacrolimus"],"offsets":[[74,84]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6853","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[86,91]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6854","type":"Chemical","text":["tacrolimus"],"offsets":[[235,245]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6855","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[247,252]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6856","type":"Disease","text":["IgA nephropathy"],"offsets":[[804,819]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005922"}]},{"id":"6857","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[873,878]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6858","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[879,890]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6859","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[914,919]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6860","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[920,931]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6861","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1029,1034]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6862","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1035,1046]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6863","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1070,1075]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6864","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1076,1087]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6865","type":"Disease","text":["focal segmental glomerulosclerosis"],"offsets":[[1225,1259]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005923"}]},{"id":"6866","type":"Disease","text":["interstitial fibrosis"],"offsets":[[1297,1318]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005355"}]},{"id":"6867","type":"Chemical","text":["creatinine"],"offsets":[[1344,1354]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003404"}]},{"id":"6868","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1399,1404]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6869","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1405,1416]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6870","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1524,1529]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6871","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1530,1541]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6872","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1610,1615]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6873","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1616,1627]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"6874","type":"Chemical","text":["FK506"],"offsets":[[1762,1767]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"6875","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[1768,1779]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"6876","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6852","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6877","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6853","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6878","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6854","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6879","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6855","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6880","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6857","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6881","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6859","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6882","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6861","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6883","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6863","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6884","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6868","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6885","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6870","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6886","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6872","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]},{"id":"6887","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6874","arg2_id":"6865","normalized":[]}]}

In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9. The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells.

Data from a Transnational case-control study were used to assess the risk of VTE for the latter patterns of use, while accounting for duration of use. Over the period 1993-1996, 551 cases of VTE were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls. Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns. The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills. We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of VTE when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills.

Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it. METHODS: We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR. In addition to renal allografts with TG, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent glomerulonephritis, chronic allograft nephropathy and stable grafts (\"protocol biopsies\"). Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, malignant hypertension, acute interstitial nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis. RESULTS: We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of TG, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without TG, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens. These 13 included cases of malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein nephritis, crescentic glomerulonephritis, and cocaine-related acute renal failure. Mild PTCR in allografts without TG did not predict renal failure or significant proteinuria after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and TG, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of TG is unclear.

Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: BD1018 (3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), BD1063 (1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine), and LR132 (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine). Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors. The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine, opioid, GABA(A) and NMDA receptors. In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018, BD1063, or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality. Moreover, post-treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals. In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine. At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, BD1018, BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine-induced

Torsades de pointes (TDP) is a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD). TDP is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. terfenadine and terodiline). 2. The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog. Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated: terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride and E4031. On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target, free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man. Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3. These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine (1.9 nM), terodiline (76 nM), cisapride (11 nM) and E4031 (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects. For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic (terfenadine, terodiline, cisapride) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man (< 10-fold) reflecting their limited safety margins.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in the emergency department of a central-city teaching hospital. Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache, nausea, or vomiting were eligible for inclusion. Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2-minute push (bolus group) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15-minute period (infusion group). The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration. Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient-reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator-observed akathisia rating scale. The intensity of headache and nausea was measured with a 100-mm visual analog scale. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled. One study participant was excluded after protocol violation. Seventy-three percent (73\/99) of the study participants were treated for headache and 70% (70\/99) for nausea. In the bolus group, 26.0% (13\/50) had akathisia compared with 32.7% (16\/49) in the infusion group (Delta=-6.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -24.6% to 11.2%). The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50% reduction in their headache intensity within 30 minutes was 11.8% (95% CI -9.6% to 33.3%). The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50% reduction in their nausea was 12.6% (95% CI -4.6% to 29.8%). CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of akathisia when prochlorperazine was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected. The efficacy of prochlorperazine in the treatment of headache and nausea likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration, although no formal statistical comparisons were made."],"offsets":[[180,2381]]}],"entities":[{"id":"7415","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[30,46]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7416","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[124,133]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7417","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[230,239]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7418","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[276,292]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7419","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[514,530]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7420","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[535,543]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"7421","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[545,551]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"7422","type":"Disease","text":["vomiting"],"offsets":[[556,564]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014839"}]},{"id":"7423","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[649,665]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7424","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[942,951]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7425","type":"Disease","text":["agitation"],"offsets":[[1061,1070]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011595"}]},{"id":"7426","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[1120,1129]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7427","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[1199,1208]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7428","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[1240,1248]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"7429","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[1253,1259]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"7430","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[1487,1495]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"7431","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[1516,1522]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"7432","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[1562,1571]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7433","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[1803,1811]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"7434","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[1950,1956]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"7435","type":"Disease","text":["akathisia"],"offsets":[[2040,2049]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017109"}]},{"id":"7436","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[2055,2071]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7437","type":"Chemical","text":["prochlorperazine"],"offsets":[[2201,2217]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011346"}]},{"id":"7438","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[2238,2246]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"7439","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[2251,2257]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"7440","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7416","normalized":[]},{"id":"7441","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7417","normalized":[]},{"id":"7442","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7424","normalized":[]},{"id":"7443","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7426","normalized":[]},{"id":"7444","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7427","normalized":[]},{"id":"7445","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7432","normalized":[]},{"id":"7446","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7415","arg2_id":"7435","normalized":[]},{"id":"7447","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7416","normalized":[]},{"id":"7448","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7417","normalized":[]},{"id":"7449","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7424","normalized":[]},{"id":"7450","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7426","normalized":[]},{"id":"7451","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7427","normalized":[]},{"id":"7452","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7432","normalized":[]},{"id":"7453","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7418","arg2_id":"7435","normalized":[]},{"id":"7454","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7416","normalized":[]},{"id":"7455","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7417","normalized":[]},{"id":"7456","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7424","normalized":[]},{"id":"7457","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7426","normalized":[]},{"id":"7458","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7427","normalized":[]},{"id":"7459","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7432","normalized":[]},{"id":"7460","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7419","arg2_id":"7435","normalized":[]},{"id":"7461","type":"CID","arg1_id":"7423","arg2_id":"7416","normalized":[]},{"id":"7462"

Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na  ve Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal.

The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg\/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+\/-509 versus 28 050+\/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+\/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension."],"offsets":[[74,1775]]}],"entities":[{"id":"7591","type":"Chemical","text":["dexamethasone"],"offsets":[[9,22]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003907"}]},{"id":"7592","type":"Disease","text":["hypertension"],"offsets":[[32,44]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006973"}]},{"id":"7593","type":"Disease","text":["renal

Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA\/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA\/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA\/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for CPA\/EE use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA\/EE in women with acne, hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication cannot be

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g\/dl to 14.0 g\/dl, 13.5 g\/dl, 13.2 g\/dl and 12.7 g\/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g\/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +\/- 0.1 g\/dl (X +\/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +\/- 0.17 (X +\/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g\/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng\/ml versus T > or = 3 ng\/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times\/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of

The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg\/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats.

The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning.

The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and\/or I1-receptors. Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine (600 microg\/kg) or alpha-methyldopa (100 mg\/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement. Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. In sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. SDRR was reduced only by alpha-methyldopa. Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension. The enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity. Estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg\/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha-methyldopa to sham-operated levels.

METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomly assigned to raloxifene 60 mg\/d or 120 mg\/d or placebo. Outcomes included venous thromboembolism, cataracts, gallbladder disease, and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8). The excess event rate was 1.8 per 1,000 woman-years (95% CI -0.5-4.1), and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 (95% CI 100-582) over 3.3 years. Risk in the raloxifene group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years, but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter. Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7). CONCLUSION: Raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism, but there was no increased risk for cataracts, gallbladder disease, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer.

METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study. Twenty-five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg\/day) plus calcium (500 mg\/day). Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only calcium. Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits. Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test. Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33).

Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours. She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter. All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours.

METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (estradiol- and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index).

Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability\/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival\/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the

What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug. We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases. All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate. In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-necrotic fibres.

Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-\/-). Alpha2ABC-\/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-\/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-\/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg\/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg\/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors."],"offsets":[[114,1921]]}],"entities":[{"id":"8650","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclic nucleotide"],"offsets":[[57,74]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009712"}]},{"id":"8651","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[103,112]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8652","type":"Disease","text":["cardiovascular disease"],"offsets":[[215,237]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002318"}]},{"id":"8653","type":"Disease","text":["arrhythmia"],"offsets":[[249,259]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001145"}]},{"id":"8654","type":"Disease","text":["coronary heart disease"],"offsets":[[261,283]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003327"}]},{"id":"8655","type":"Disease","text":["heart failure"],"offsets":[[297,310]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006333"}]},{"id":"8656","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[435,444]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8657","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[538,547]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8658","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[586,595]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8659","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[855,864]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8660","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[875,884]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8661","type":"Chemical","text":["Clonidine"],"offsets":[[957,966]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8662","type":"Disease","text":["bradycardia"],"offsets":[[975,986]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001919"}]},{"id":"8663","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[1134,1143]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8664","type":"Chemical","text":["Clonidine"],"offsets":[[1247,1256]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8665","type":"Chemical","text":["cyclic nucleotide"],"offsets":[[1399,1416]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009712"}]},{"id":"8666","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[1513,1522]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8667","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[1791,1800]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"8668","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[1839,1848]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"8669","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8651","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8670","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8656","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8671","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8657","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8672","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8658","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8673","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8659","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8674","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8660","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8675","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8661","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8676","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8663","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8677","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8664","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8678","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8666","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8679","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8667","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]},{"id":"8680","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8668","arg2_id":"8662","normalized":[]}]}

The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity."],"offsets":[[151,1840]]}],"entities":[{"id":"8684","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[13,20]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8685","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[49,56]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8686","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[179,186]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8687","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[242,249]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8688","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[326,333]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8689","type":"Disease","text":["hearing loss"],"offsets":[[370,382]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D034381"}]},{"id":"8690","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[463,470]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8691","type":"Disease","text":["hearing impairment"],"offsets":[[612,630]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D034381"}]},{"id":"8692","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[703,710]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8693","type":"Disease","text":["decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes"],"offsets":[[1331,1361]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"8694","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[1551,1558]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]},{"id":"8695","type":"Chemical","text":["smoking"],"offsets":[[1800,1807]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012906"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"8696","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8684","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8697","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8684","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8698","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8685","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8699","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8685","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8700","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8686","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8701","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8686","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8702","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8687","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8703","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8687","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8704","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8688","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8705","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8688","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8706","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8690","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8707","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8690","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8708","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8692","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8709","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8692","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8710","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8694","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8711","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8694","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]},{"id":"8712","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8695","arg2_id":"8689","normalized":[]},{"id":"8713","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8695","arg2_id":"8691","normalized":[]}]}

In addition to genetic influences, recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for autism. Terbutaline, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor, has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins. We studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats. Newborn rats were given terbutaline (10 mg\/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30. Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter. None of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on PN 11 to 14. In behavioral tests, animals treated with terbutaline on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test. Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities, similar to those described in autism.

There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use. RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine. The patient recovered with intensive medical support. The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient setting. Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and unaccustomed physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine. It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early. Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis, there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients.

While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -\/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +\/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -\/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +\/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +\/- and wild-type C57BL6\/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice."],"offsets":[[114,1555]]}],"entities":[{"id":"8879","type":"Chemical","text":["Norepinephrine"],"offsets":[[0,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009638"}]},{"id":"8880","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[89,96]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8881","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[105,112]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8882","type":"Chemical","text":["Cocaine"],"offsets":[[126,133]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8883","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[250,257]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8884","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[385,392]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8885","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[402,409]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8886","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[467,475]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"8887","type":"Chemical","text":["norepinephrine"],"offsets":[[529,543]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009638"}]},{"id":"8888","type":"Chemical","text":["NE"],"offsets":[[545,547]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009638"}]},{"id":"8889","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[640,647]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8890","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[656,663]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8891","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[688,695]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8892","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[723,730]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8893","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[942,949]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8894","type":"Chemical","text":["Cocaine"],"offsets":[[951,958]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8895","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[967,974]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8896","type":"Chemical","text":["disulfiram"],"offsets":[[1039,1049]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004221"}]},{"id":"8897","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[1053,1061]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"8898","type":"Chemical","text":["propranolol"],"offsets":[[1222,1233]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011433"}]},{"id":"8899","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[1242,1249]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8900","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[1258,1265]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]},{"id":"8901","type":"Chemical","text":["prazosin"],"offsets":[[1350,1358]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011224"}]},{"id":"8902","type":"Chemical","text":["yohimbine"],"offsets":[[1387,1396]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015016"}]},{"id":"8903","type":"Chemical","text":["cocaine"],"offsets":[[1523,1530]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003042"}]},{"id":"8904","type":"Disease","text":["anxiety"],"offsets":[[1539,1546]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001008"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"8905","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8881","normalized":[]},{"id":"8906","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8885","normalized":[]},{"id":"8907","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8890","normalized":[]},{"id":"8908","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8892","normalized":[]},{"id":"8909","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8895","normalized":[]},{"id":"8910","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8900","normalized":[]},{"id":"8911","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8880","arg2_id":"8904","normalized":[]},{"id":"8912","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8881","normalized":[]},{"id":"8913","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8885","normalized":[]},{"id":"8914","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8890","normalized":[]},{"id":"8915","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8892","normalized":[]},{"id":"8916","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8895","normalized":[]},{"id":"8917","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8900","normalized":[]},{"id":"8918","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8882","arg2_id":"8904","normalized":[]},{"id":"8919","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8881","normalized":[]},{"id":"8920","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8885","normalized":[]},{"id":"8921","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8890","normalized":[]},{"id":"8922","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8892","normalized":[]},{"id":"8923","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8895","normalized":[]},{"id":"8924","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8900","normalized":[]},{"id":"8925","type":"CID","arg1_id":"8883","arg2_id":"8904","normalized":[]},{"id":"8926","typ

METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg\/day for clonidine and 60 mg\/day for methylphenidate (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs. RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p =.0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common on clonidine, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD.

However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse. This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-\/-) and DAT(-\/-)). Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg\/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-\/-) mice. In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-\/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg\/kg p.o.). Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity. However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg\/kg p.o.

We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +\/- 12 to 81 +\/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +\/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +\/- 8% to 60 +\/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +\/- 1.1 to 3.4 +\/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +\/- 9 to 79 +\/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +\/- 1.2 to 5.0 +\/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2).

None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2C, but not serotonin 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD-like profile in animals.

In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. Nicotine (1.0 mg\/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1\/D2 antagonist fluphenazine. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect.

Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg\/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups.

Twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg\/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg\/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg\/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg\/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg\/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg\/kg per dose.

Thirty-six patients were treated with BCNU every 6 to 8 weeks, either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system, beginning with a dose of 200 mg\/sq m body surface area. Twelve patients with Grade III or IV astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therapy. After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy, nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans. In the nine responders, median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks (range 12 to more than 91 weeks). The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks (range 21 to more than 156 weeks), with an 18-month survival rate of 42%. Twenty-four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV astrocytomas, whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed, received two to eight courses of intra-arterial BCNU therapy. Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks (range 6 to more than 66 weeks).

At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level.

The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low.

During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months).

Lesions of the capillary included necrosis of endothelial cells. Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered. Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had luminal protrusions and swollen microvilli. Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes. Fragments of necrotic endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions. Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed. Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes. The proliferation of astrocytes (Bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found. Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells are earliest).

Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). Trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer

The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis.

This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM-induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM-induced hemolysis. Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM-induced cell oxidative stress. Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K(+) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either alpha-T or alpha-TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, TAM-induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action."],"offsets":[[101,2585]]}],"entities":[{"id":"11122","type":"Disease","text":["Hemolysis"],"offsets":[[0,9]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006461"}]},{"id":"11123","type":"Chemical","text":["tamoxifen"],"offsets":[[43,52]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013629"}]},{"id":"11124","type":"Chemical","text":["Tamoxifen"],"offsets":[[101,110]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013629"}]},{"id":"11125","type":"Chemical","text":["TAM"],"offsets":[[112,115]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013629"}]},{"id":"11126","type":"Disease","text":["breast

Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension. In several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue. To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na+, we studied the response of cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase to NO-deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO-synthase inhibition with 40 mg\/kg\/day N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 4 four weeks. After 4-week administration of L-NAME, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 36%. Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value. When activating the (Na,K)-ATPase with its substrate ATP, no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO-deficient rats. During activation with Na+, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the K(Na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na+-binding site in NO-deficient rats. After recovery from hypertension, the activity of (Na,K)-ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP-binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP. The K(Na) value for Na+ returned to control value. Inhibition of NO-synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na+-binding properties of the (Na,K)-ATPase. After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of Na+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (Na,K)-ATPase

This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg\/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg\/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2

Previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration (0.5 mg\/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine-induced bradycardia.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments. Capsaicin 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i.v. infusion of ketamine (bolus 0.1 mg kg-1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg-1 min-1), lidocaine 5 mg kg-1 or saline for 50 min. Infusion started 15 min after injection of capsaicin. The following were measured: spontaneous pain, pain evoked by punctate and brush stimuli (VAS), and areas of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia. Ketamine reduced both the area of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush-evoked pain. Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly. It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous pain but had no effect on evoked pain. The differential effects of ketamine and lidocaine on static and dynamic hyperalgesia suggest that the two types of hyperalgesia are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct

Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion. However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine. As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine-induced TMA. With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus-associated TMA has also been recognized. However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited. We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine-induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA."],"offsets":[[67,1635]]}],"entities":[{"id":"11802","type":"Chemical","text":["Cyclosporine"],"offsets":[[0,12]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016572"}]},{"id":"11803","type":"Chemical","text":["tacrolimus"],"offsets":[[17,27]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016559"}]},{"id":"11804","type":"Disease","text":["thrombotic

He was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, treated with high-dose diuretics. Due to severe systolic dysfunction losartan was prescribed. Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria, which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion. One week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours. During these two episodes, his blood pressure diminished but no severe hypotension was noted. Ultimately, an arteriography showed a 70-80% renal artery stenosis. In this patient, renal artery stenosis combined with heart failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Under such conditions, angiotensin II receptor blockade by losartan probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure. This case report highlights the fact that the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with renovascular disease and should be used with extreme caution in this

This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg\/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg\/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg\/Kg\/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg\/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and\/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and\/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo."],"offsets":[[250,2775]]}],"entities":[{"id":"12041","type":"Disease","text":["necrotic"],"offsets":[[58,66]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009336"}]},{"id":"12042","type":"Chemical","text":["acetaminophen"],"offsets":[[86,99]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000082"}]},{"id":"12043","type":"Disease","text":["nephrotoxicity"],"offsets":[[108,122]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"12044","type":"Chemical","text":["amiodarone"],"offsets":[[124,134]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000638"}]},{"id":"12045","type":"Disease","text":["lung

On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, pain-induced functional impairment model, and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit. Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+\/-7 vs. 139+\/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+\/-17 vs. 131+\/-22 ua; P<0.001). Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+\/-10 vs. 18+\/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+\/-7 vs. 280+\/-17 au). Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg\/kg naloxone s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed. In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+\/-4% and 38+\/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects. The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine-induced constipation.

OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance abuse and the increased risk of visual field defects (VFD) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose GVG on cocaine-induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA). METHODS: Using in vivo microdialysis, we compared acute exposure (450 mg\/kg) to an identical sub-chronic exposure (150 mg\/kg per day for 3 days), followed by 1- or 3-day washout. Finally, we examined the low dose of 150 mg\/kg (50 mg\/kg per day) using a similar washout period. RESULTS: Sub-chronic GVG exposure inhibited the effect of cocaine for 3 days, which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose.

METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium, and tested associations with potential risk factors. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40.8 +\/- 12.1 years, hospitalized for 24.9 +\/- 23.3 days, and given clozapine, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 +\/- 203 mg (3.45 +\/- 2.45 mg\/kg) for 18.9 +\/- 16.4 days. Delirium was diagnosed in 14 (10.1 % incidence, or 1.48 cases\/person-years of exposure); 71.4 % of cases were moderate or severe. Associated factors were co-treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents, poor clinical outcome, older age, and longer hospitalization (by 17.5 days, increasing cost); sex, diagnosis or medical co-morbidity, and daily clozapine dose, which fell with age, were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics.

Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions. An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa. Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry. Capsaicin (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases in dural and cortical blood flow and provoked lacrimation. These responses were blocked by systemic pre-administration of hexamethonium chloride (20 mg\/kg). The evoked increases in dural blood flow were also abolished by topical pre-administration of atropine (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater.

Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -\/- brains. alpha3 +\/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +\/- brains.

METHODS: All patients with a diagnosed cerebral haemorrhage at three hospitals during the period 2000-2002 were identified. Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin-drug interactions could have caused the cerebral haemorrhage. The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated. RESULTS: Among 593 patients with cerebral haemorrhage, 59 (10%) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment. This imply an incidence of 1.7\/100,000 treatment years. Of the 59 cases, 26 (44%) had a fatal outcome, compared to 136 (25%) among the non-warfarin patients (p < 0.01). A warfarin-drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 (41%) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these (12%) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin-induced cerebral haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate. Almost half of the cases was related to a warfarin-drug interaction. A significant proportion of warfarin-related cerebral haemorrhages might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with

SETTING: St. Luke's Hospital, Gwardamangia, Malta. METHODS: A double-blind double-armed prospective study comprised 40 patients who had uneventful sutureless phacoemulsification under sub-Tenon's local infiltration of 3 mL of plain lignocaine. At the end of the procedure, Group A (n = 20) had 20 mg\/0.5 mL of methylprednisolone and 10 mg\/0.5 mL of gentamicin injected into the posterior sub-Tenon's space and Group B (n = 20) had the same combination injected into the anterior sub-Tenon's space. Postoperatively, all patients were assessed for symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and headache. A chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance of results. RESULTS: Sixty percent in Group A developed postoperative emetic symptoms, headache, or both; 1 patient in Group B developed symptoms.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL\/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg\/dL (44.2 micromol\/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg\/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after iopamidol and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after iodixanol (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44). In patients with diabetes, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg\/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with iopamidol and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with iodixanol (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg\/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol\/L, P=0.03; patients with diabetes: 0.07 versus 0.16 mg\/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol\/L, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by multiple end points, is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high-risk patients, with or without diabetes mellitus. Any true difference between the agents is small and not likely to be clinically significant."],"offsets":[[168,2258]]}],"entities":[{"id":"12912","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[115,126]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"12913","type":"Disease","text":["chronic

The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent pain model which could be distinguished from acute pain models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated, neurochemical substrates, and duration of the nociceptive stimulus. To this end, persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured. For comparison, tests were conducted in two acute pain models, the hotplate and warm water tail-withdrawal procedures. In males, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of morphine in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Across the doses and pretreatment times examined, enhancement was not observed in females. Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute pain models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males.

Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration."],"offsets":[[116,1799]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13255","type":"Chemical","text":["Methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[0,15]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"13256","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[24,37]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"13257","type":"Chemical","text":["Methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[116,131]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"13258","type":"Chemical","text":["METH"],"offsets":[[133,137]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"13259","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[147,155]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"13260","type":"Chemical","text":["DA"],"offsets":[[157,159]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"13261","type":"Chemical","text":["MPTP"],"offsets":[[466,470]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015632"}]},{"id":"13262","type":"Disease","text":["neurodegeneration"],"offsets":[[479,496]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009422"}]},{"id":"13263","type":"Chemical","text":["DA"],"offsets":[[500,502]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"13264","type":"Disease","text":["CNS

However, the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and severity of valvular heart abnormality and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case-control study. METHODS: All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography. Thirty PD patients participated in the study. A second echocardiography was performed (median interval: 13 months) after pergolide withdrawal (n=10 patients). Controls were age- and sex-matched non-PD patients referred to the cardiology department. RESULTS: Compared to controls, aortic regurgitation (OR: 3.1; 95% IC: 1.1-8.8) and mitral regurgitation (OR: 10.7; 95% IC: 2.1-53) were more frequent in PD patients (tricuspid: NS). The number of affected valves (n=2.4+\/-0.7) and the sum of regurgitation grades (n=2.8+\/-1.09) were higher (p=0.008 and p=0.006, respectively) in the pergolide group. Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with pergolide cumulative dose. A restrictive pattern of valvular regurgitation, suggestive of the role of pergolide, was observed in 12\/30 (40%) patients including two with heart failure. Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular heart disease, resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination. This study supports the high frequency of restrictive valve regurgitation in PD patients treated with pergolide and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non-ergot dopamine agonists."],"offsets":[[126,2030]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13338","type":"Disease","text":["Valvular heart

Transient cranial nerve dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine. This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm. Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients. The timing of papaverine application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations. FINDINGS: A temporal relationship was found between topical papaverine and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss. The average temporal delay between papaverine and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min. In 10 of 11 patients, BAEP waves II\/III-V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after papaverine. Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min. One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound sensorineural hearing loss. The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre-papaverine baseline values was 39 min. CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway. The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve.

The aldosterone-sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess. The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome. To this end, doxorubicin (15 mug\/g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 (sgk1(-\/-)) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1(+\/+)). Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria (>100 mg protein\/mg crea) in 15\/44 of sgk1(+\/+) and 15\/44 of sgk1(-\/-) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites, lipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes. Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+\/+) mice. Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+\/+) mice (15 +\/- 5 mumol\/mg crea) than in sgk1(-\/-) mice (35 +\/- 5 mumol\/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1(+\/+) compared with sgk1(-\/-) mice (+6.6 +\/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +\/- 0.8 g). During the course of nephrotic syndrome, serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-\/-) mice than in sgk1(+\/+) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-\/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+\/+) mice).

To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria\/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria.

{"id":"13774","document_id":"19729346","passages":[{"id":"13775","type":"title","text":["Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy middle-aged and older adults."],"offsets":[[0,121]]},{"id":"13776","type":"abstract","text":["This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain. Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg oxycodone). Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01). Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults."],"offsets":[[122,1734]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13777","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[71,80]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]},{"id":"13778","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[238,247]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]},{"id":"13779","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[377,381]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"13780","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[495,504]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]},{"id":"13781","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[514,523]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]},{"id":"13782","type":"Disease","text":["declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory"],"offsets":[[738,815]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003072"},{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008569"}]},{"id":"13783","type":"Disease","text":["declines in simple and sustained attention"],"offsets":[[738,780]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003072"}]},{"id":"13784","type":"Disease","text":["declines in","working memory, and verbal memory"],"offsets":[[738,749],[782,815]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008569"}]},{"id":"13785","type":"Disease","text":["chronic pain"],"offsets":[[1210,1222]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D059350"}]},{"id":"13786","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[1316,1325]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]},{"id":"13787","type":"Chemical","text":["oxycodone"],"offsets":[[1496,1505]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010098"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"13788","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13777","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13789","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13777","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13790","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13778","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13791","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13778","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13792","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13780","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13793","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13780","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13794","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13781","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13795","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13781","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13796","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13786","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13797","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13786","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13798","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13787","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13799","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13787","arg2_id":"13784","normalized":[]},{"id":"13800","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13777","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13801","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13777","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]},{"id":"13802","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13778","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13803","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13778","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]},{"id":"13804","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13780","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13805","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13780","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]},{"id":"13806","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13781","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13807","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13781","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]},{"id":"13808","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13786","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13809","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13786","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]},{"id":"13810","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13787","arg2_id":"13782","normalized":[]},{"id":"13811","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13787","arg2_id":"13783","normalized":[]}]}

METHOD: Twenty cocaine-dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive modafinil, 400 mg (N=10), or placebo (N=10) every morning at 7:30 a.m. for 16 days in an inpatient, double-blind randomized trial. Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3, 7 to 9, and 14 to 16 (first, second, and third weeks of abstinence). The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11:30 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. on days 2, 8, and 15. For comparison of sleep architecture variables, 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography. RESULTS: Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes. Compared with placebo, modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow-wave sleep time in cocaine-dependent participants. The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence. Comparison of slow-wave sleep time, total sleep time, and sleep latency in cocaine-dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine-dependent participants. Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness.

Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged."],"offsets":[[146,1586]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13927","type":"Chemical","text":["puromycin aminonucleoside"],"offsets":[[109,134]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011692"}]},{"id":"13928","type":"Disease","text":["nephrosis"],"offsets":[[135,144]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009401"}]},{"id":"13929","type":"Disease","text":["proteinuria"],"offsets":[[219,230]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13930","type":"Chemical","text":["puromycin aminonucleoside"],"offsets":[[245,270]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011692"}]},{"id":"13931","type":"Disease","text":["nephrosis"],"offsets":[[271,280]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009401"}]},{"id":"13932","type":"Disease","text":["proteinuria"],"offsets":[[816,827]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13933","type":"Disease","text":["proteinuria"],"offsets":[[1036,1047]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13934","type":"Disease","text":["proteinuria"],"offsets":[[1357,1368]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"13935","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13929","normalized":[]},{"id":"13936","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13932","normalized":[]},{"id":"13937","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13933","normalized":[]},{"id":"13938","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13934","normalized":[]},{"id":"13939","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13929","normalized":[]},{"id":"13940","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13932","normalized":[]},{"id":"13941","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13933","normalized":[]},{"id":"13942","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13934","normalized":[]},{"id":"13943","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13928","normalized":[]},{"id":"13944","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13927","arg2_id":"13931","normalized":[]},{"id":"13945","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13928","normalized":[]},{"id":"13946","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13930","arg2_id":"13931","normalized":[]}]}

To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%.

However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg\/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg\/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and

BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries (\"meth mouth\"), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug. SUMMARY: The patient's medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of \"meth mouth.\" Although three different dental treatment modalities (either conventional or implant-supported) have been offered to the patient since August 2007, the patient has yet to initiate any treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing methamphetamines. Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients, as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification."],"offsets":[[52,1814]]}],"entities":[{"id":"14268","type":"Disease","text":["meth mouth"],"offsets":[[24,34]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"14269","type":"Disease","text":["meth mouth"],"offsets":[[140,150]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"14270","type":"Chemical","text":["Methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[226,241]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"14271","type":"Disease","text":["cardiac dysrhythmias"],"offsets":[[369,389]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001145"}]},{"id":"14272","type":"Disease","text":["hypertension"],"offsets":[[391,403]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006973"}]},{"id":"14273","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinations"],"offsets":[[405,419]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"14274","type":"Disease","text":["violent behavior"],"offsets":[[425,441]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001523"}]},{"id":"14275","type":"Chemical","text":["methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[467,482]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"14276","type":"Disease","text":["xerostomia"],"offsets":[[519,529]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014987"}]},{"id":"14277","type":"Disease","text":["caries"],"offsets":[[539,545]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003731"}]},{"id":"14278","type":"Disease","text":["meth mouth"],"offsets":[[548,558]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"14279","type":"Disease","text":["tooth wear"],"offsets":[[576,586]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D057085"}]},{"id":"14280","type":"Chemical","text":["methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[626,641]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"14281","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[732,736]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"14282","type":"Disease","text":["bad breath"],"offsets":[[738,748]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012120"}]},{"id":"14283","type":"Disease","text":["carious lesions"],"offsets":[[903,918]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003731"}]},{"id":"14284","type":"Chemical","text":["methamphetamine"],"offsets":[[990,1005]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]},{"id":"14285","type":"Disease","text":["carious episodes"],"offsets":[[1055,1071]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003731"}]},{"id":"14286","type":"Disease","text":["meth mouth"],"offsets":[[1229,1239]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"14287","type":"Disease","text":["meth mouth"],"offsets":[[1510,1520]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"14288","type":"Chemical","text":["methamphetamines"],"offsets":[[1613,1629]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008694"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"14289","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14270","arg2_id":"14277","normalized":[]},{"id":"14290","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14270","arg2_id":"14283","normalized":[]},{"id":"14291","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14270","arg2_id":"14285","normalized":[]},{"id":"14292","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14275","arg2_id":"14277","normalized":[]},{"id":"14293","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14275","arg2_id":"14283","normalized":[]},{"id":"14294","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14275","arg2_id":"14285","normalized":[]},{"id":"14295","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14280","arg2_id":"14277","normalized":[]},{"id":"14296","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14280","arg2_id":"14283","normalized":[]},{"id":"14297","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14280","arg2_id":"14285","normalized":[]},{"id":"14298","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14284","arg2_id":"14277","normalized":[]},{"id":"14299","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14284","arg2_id":"14283","normalized":[]},{"id":"14300","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14284","arg2_id":"14285","normalized":[]},{"id":"14301","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14288","arg2_id":"14277","normalized":[]},{"id":"14302","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14288","arg2_id":"14283","normalized":[]},{"id":"14303","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14288","arg2_id":"14285","normalized":[]}]}

Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg\/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg\/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine.

The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), the most common being the K- and the A-variants. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT. METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months. We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects. RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent. The duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly

Eleven patients (six male) with median age 47 years (range 27-73), median disease duration 50 months (range 9-178) and median follow-up period of patients 13.8 months (range 5-27) were enrolled in this study. Lamivudine therapy was started 3-7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients. Baseline, liver function tests were elevated in two patients (fourth patient: ALT:122 IU\/l, AST:111 IU\/l, tenth patient:ALT:294 IU\/l, AST:274 IU\/l, with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both). Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow-up period none of the patients had abnormal liver function tests. In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline. Two of these normalized and the others increased later. In three additional patients, HBV DNA levels were increased during follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan (MZ) and Flumazenil (FL) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate. METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+\/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+\/-1.9 mg and 0.28+\/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+\/-6.1 minutes and 60+\/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events.

Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are

Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse. In order to address long-term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals. Pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1\/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection. Subjects also recalled their pains one week later. Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions. The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes. Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day. Pain recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05). Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces.

Capsaicin (10 micro g) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunteers. Short-latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before, during, and after the pain. The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement, but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity.

The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity."],"offsets":[[82,1829]]}],"entities":[{"id":"14944","type":"Chemical","text":["trimipramine"],"offsets":[[9,21]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14945","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[30,38]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"14946","type":"Chemical","text":["Trimipramine"],"offsets":[[82,94]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14947","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[96,99]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14948","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressant"],"offsets":[[125,139]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"14949","type":"Chemical","text":["imipramine"],"offsets":[[175,185]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007099"}]},{"id":"14950","type":"Chemical","text":["noradrenaline"],"offsets":[[223,236]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009638"}]},{"id":"14951","type":"Chemical","text":["5-hydroxytryptamine"],"offsets":[[241,260]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012701"}]},{"id":"14952","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressant"],"offsets":[[335,349]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"14953","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[430,433]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14954","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressants"],"offsets":[[580,595]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"14955","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[597,600]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14956","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[717,720]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14957","type":"Chemical","text":["reserpine"],"offsets":[[758,767]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012110"}]},{"id":"14958","type":"Disease","text":["hypothermia"],"offsets":[[768,779]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007035"}]},{"id":"14959","type":"Chemical","text":["5-hydroxytryptophan"],"offsets":[[816,835]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006916"}]},{"id":"14960","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[859,862]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14961","type":"Disease","text":["hyperactivity"],"offsets":[[912,925]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006948"}]},{"id":"14962","type":"Chemical","text":["d-amphetamine"],"offsets":[[937,950]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003913"}]},{"id":"14963","type":"Chemical","text":["quinpirole"],"offsets":[[952,962]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D019257"}]},{"id":"14964","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[1005,1013]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"14965","type":"Chemical","text":["d-amphetamine"],"offsets":[[1062,1075]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003913"}]},{"id":"14966","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1079,1090]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"14967","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[1114,1117]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14968","type":"Chemical","text":["phenylephrine"],"offsets":[[1168,1181]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010656"}]},{"id":"14969","type":"Disease","text":["aggressiveness"],"offsets":[[1266,1280]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010554"}]},{"id":"14970","type":"Chemical","text":["clonidine"],"offsets":[[1291,1300]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003000"}]},{"id":"14971","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressants"],"offsets":[[1425,1440]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"14972","type":"Chemical","text":["TRI"],"offsets":[[1461,1464]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014299"}]},{"id":"14973","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[1520,1528]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"14974","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressants"],"offsets":[[1752,1767]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]},{"id":"14975","type":"Chemical","text":["antidepressant"],"offsets":[[1805,1819]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000928"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"14976","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14962","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14977","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14965","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14978","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14957","arg2_id":"14958","normalized":[]},{"id":"14979","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14944","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14980","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14946","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14981","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14947","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14982","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14953","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14983","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14955","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14984","type":"CID","arg1_id":"14956","arg2_id":"14961","normalized":[]},{"id":"14985","type":"CID","arg1_id

Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment. Using this rationale, the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment. METHODS: In this study, WR242511 was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and\/or 7.0 mg\/kg; a single male also received WR242511 orally (PO) at 7.0 mg\/kg. Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure. RESULTS: The selected doses of WR242511, which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey. Furthermore, transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 (3.5 or 7.0 mg\/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg\/kg dose. Myoglobinuria was also observed following the 7.0 mg\/kg dose. Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed liver and kidney toxicity, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct and\/or indirect drug-induced toxicity. It is concluded that WR242511 should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN poisoning unless the anti-CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable

In another series of measurements, reproducibility and reference values of the tremor was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions, at 9 a.m., 4 p.m. and 9 a.m., respectively, 1 week later. Postural tremor was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest tremor with the arm supported by an armrest and finally tremor was measured after holding a 2-kg weight until exhaustion. Inter-observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects. Tremor was measured simultaneously by two independent observers. RESULTS: Salbutamol significantly increased tremor severity in patients in a dose-dependent way. Within healthy adults no age-dependency could be found (b = 0.262 mm\/year; P = 0.72). There was no agreement between the questionnaire and tremor severity (r = 0.093; P = 0.53). Postural tremor showed no significant difference between the first and third session (P = 0.07). Support of the arm decreased tremor severity, exhaustion increased tremor severity significantly. A good agreement was found between two independent observers (interclass correlation coefficient 0.72). DISCUSSION: Quantifying tremor by using an inexpensive laser pointer is, with the exception of children (<12 years) a sensitive and reproducible method."],"offsets":[[76,2061]]}],"entities":[{"id":"15177","type":"Disease","text":["Tremor"],"offsets":[[0,6]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014202"}]},{"id":"15178","type":"Chemical","text":["salbutamol"],"offsets":[[23,33]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000420"}]},{"id":"15179","type":"Disease","text":["tremor"],"offsets":[[96,102]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014202"}]},{"id":"15180","type":"Chemical","text":["salbutamol"],"offsets":[[119,129]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000420"}]},{"id":"15181","type":"Disease","text":["Tremor"],"offsets":[[406,412]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014202"}]},{"id":"15182","type":"Disease","text":["tremor"],"offsets":[[496,502]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014202"}]},{"id":"15183","type":"Disease","text":["obstructive

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial. SETTING: National Institutes of Health clinical research center. PATIENTS: Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. INTERVENTION: Each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg\/m2\/week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off, or the combination of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen. This 4-week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: None of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed VTE, whereas 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: The addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of VTE.

However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome. METHODS: A review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with ruptured aneurysms and no history of cocaine abuse. Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage, size of the aneurysm, location of the aneurysm, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002). In patients in the study group, all aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. The majority of these aneurysms were smaller than those of the control group (8 +\/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +\/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05). The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant. Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with cocaine-related aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use predisposed aneurysmal rupture at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller aneurysms.

The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci\/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci\/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP\/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT\/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP\/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP\/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP\/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.

BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U\/L creatine kinase, 93 mg\/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg\/dL creatinine, 1579 U\/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U\/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U\/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg\/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors."],"offsets":[[119,2018]]}],"entities":[{"id":"16055","type":"Disease","text":["rhabdomyolysis"],"offsets":[[7,21]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012206"}]},{"id":"16056","type":"Disease","text":["acute

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg\/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg\/m2\/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1).

The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and toxicity of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel (135 mg\/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg\/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg\/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for toxicity; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg\/m(2) for paclitaxel (97.3%), 117 mg\/m(2) for cisplatin (97.3%), and 1378 mg\/m(2) for gemcitabine (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC.

The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity."],"offsets":[[117,929]]}],"entities":[{"id":"16388","type":"Chemical","text":["amphetamine"],"offsets":[[43,54]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000661"}]},{"id":"16389","type":"Disease","text":["hyperactivity"],"offsets":[[63,76]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006948"}]},{"id":"16390","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[94,104]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16391","type":"Chemical","text":["Calcitonin"],"offsets":[[117,127]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16392","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[193,203]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16393","type":"Chemical","text":["amphetamine"],"offsets":[[313,324]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000661"}]},{"id":"16394","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[456,466]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16395","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[557,567]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16396","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[687,697]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16397","type":"Chemical","text":["calcitonin"],"offsets":[[865,875]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002116"}]},{"id":"16398","type":"Chemical","text":["amphetamine"],"offsets":[[890,901]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000661"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"16399","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16388","arg2_id":"16389","normalized":[]},{"id":"16400","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16393","arg2_id":"16389","normalized":[]},{"id":"16401","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16398","arg2_id":"16389","normalized":[]}]}

Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and\/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M\/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC\/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.

Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-) production. Atorvastatin (Ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2- production in various forms of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg\/kg per day, p.o., Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) downregulation and the increase in O2- in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with Ato (50 mg\/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. Dexamethasone (10 microg\/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with Dex alone, SBP was increased from 109 +\/- 2 to 133 +\/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001).

METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg\/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg\/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg\/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg\/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive

This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg\/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain.

Methamphetamine (10 mg\/kg sc), administered five times, reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection. A selective antagonist of mGluR5, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; 5 mg\/kg ip), when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above-mentioned methamphetamine effects. A single MPEP (5 mg\/kg ip) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum, as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine (10 mg\/kg sc) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine (100 microM). Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg\/kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature. MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations (500 microM) increased extracellular dopamine levels, while lower concentrations (50-100 microM) were devoid of any effect. The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine-induced toxicity.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1\/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6.

In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC\/MS\/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach.

A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood.

In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status (M.S.) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients, 30 patients had no M.S. change on cimetidine and 6 had moderate to severe changes. These 6 patients had both renal and liver dysfunction (P less than 0.05), as well as cimetidine trough-concentrations of more than 1.25 microgram\/ml (P less than 0.05). The severity of M.S. changes increased as trough-concentrations rose, 5 patients had lumbar puncture.

Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability."],"offsets":[[130,1775]]}],"entities":[{"id":"17288","type":"Disease","text":["intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis"],"offsets":[[87,128]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002780"},{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001651"}]},{"id":"17289","type":"Disease","text":["intrahepatic","cholestasis"],"offsets":[[87,99],[117,128]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002780"}]},{"id":"17290","type":"Disease","text":["extrahepatic cholestasis"],"offsets":[[104,128]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001651"}]},{"id":"17291","type":"Disease","text":["cholestasis"],"offsets":[[321,332]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002779"}]},{"id":"17292","type":"Disease","text":["intrahepatic cholestasis"],"offsets":[[678,702]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002780"}]},{"id":"17293","type":"Chemical","text":["ethinyl estradiol"],"offsets":[[706,723]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004997"}]},{"id":"17294","type":"Chemical","text":["EE"],"offsets":[[725,727]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004997"}]},{"id":"17295","type":"Disease","text":["extrahepatic cholestasis"],"offsets":[[743,767]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001651"}]},{"id":"17296","type":"Chemical","text":["EE"],"offsets":[[1356,1358]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004997"}]},{"id":"17297","type":"Chemical","text":["EE"],"offsets":[[1682,1684]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004997"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"17298","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17293","arg2_id":"17288","normalized":[]},{"id":"17299","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17293","arg2_id":"17289","normalized":[]},{"id":"17300","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17293","arg2_id":"17292","normalized":[]},{"id":"17301","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17294","arg2_id":"17288","normalized":[]},{"id":"17302","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17294","arg2_id":"17289","normalized":[]},{"id":"17303","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17294","arg2_id":"17292","normalized":[]},{"id":"17304","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17296","arg2_id":"17288","normalized":[]},{"id":"17305","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17296","arg2_id":"17289","normalized":[]},{"id":"17306","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17296","arg2_id":"17292","normalized":[]},{"id":"17307","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17297","arg2_id":"17288","normalized":[]},{"id":"17308","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17297","arg2_id":"17289","normalized":[]},{"id":"17309","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17297","arg2_id":"17292","normalized":[]}]}

METHODS: One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study. All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr\/dl. Subjects were receiving desferrioxamine (DFO) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg\/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg\/kg for the following eight years. Patients were followed for 8-14 years. RESULTS: Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), either unilateral or bilateral. No ototoxic factor, other than DFO, was present in any of the patients. Patients with SNHL presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed. Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal. Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation. CONCLUSION: The findings are indicative of DFO's contributing role in the development of hearing impairment.

Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa. The [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8\/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4\/8), FLAIR (7\/8), and T2-weighted image (8\/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8\/8), inferior colliculus (6\/8), corpus callosum (2\/8), pons (2\/8), medulla (1\/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1\/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3\/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.

Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients.

We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg\/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg\/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng\/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg\/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters\/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg\/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg\/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg\/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg\/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng\/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters\/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters\/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments."],"offsets":[[195,3282]]}],"entities":[{"id":"17606","type":"Disease","text":["myocardial

Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans.

The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients.

In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects.

In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg\/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg\/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg\/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient."],"offsets":[[105,1582]]}],"entities":[{"id":"17950","type":"Disease","text":["Epileptic

After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg\/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to

In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta\/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with D-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D-pen, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta\/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D-pen treatment.

The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg\/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg\/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, multisite, case-control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major birth defects identified via birth defect surveillance programs in 10 states (n = 13 155) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions (n = 4941). MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9). Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included erythromycins (2 defects), penicillins (1 defect), cephalosporins (1 defect), and quinolones (1 defect). CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, penicillins, erythromycins, and cephalosporins, although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth defects.

The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening

Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel\/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients. We initiated a phase I\/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma. To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each. Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease. Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg\/m2). The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits. At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg\/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable. With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg\/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms\/kg\/d is given (days 4 through 12). Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response. Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two. The overall response rate is 72%. Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery\/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy. Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses. Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias\/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2. No dose-limiting hematologic toxicity has been seen. Paclitaxel\/cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and continued study is warranted. Results thus far suggest no dose-response effect for paclitaxel doses above 200

In this study, the severity of response to other seizure-inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg\/kg gamma-HCH. One hour after the administration of gamma-HCH, the activity of seizure-inducing agents was increased, regardless of their mechanism, while 24 h after gamma-HCH a differential response was observed. Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin (PTX) was significantly decreased; however, seizure activity due to 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), bicuculline (BCC), methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), or strychnine (STR) was not different from control. In vitro, gamma-HCH, pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H-TBOB binding in mouse whole brain, with IC50 values of 4.6, 404 and 9.4 microM, respectively. MPA, BCC, DMCM, and STR showed no inhibition of 3H-TBOB (t-butyl bicyclo-orthobenzoate) binding at concentrations of 100 micron. The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma-HCH, since the response to only these two seizure-inducing agents is decreased. The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma-HCH may be the GABA-A receptor-linked chloride

With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects."],"offsets":[[108,1773]]}],"entities":[{"id":"18805","type":"Disease","text":["ocular and orbital

We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials."],"offsets":[[107,1804]]}],"entities":[{"id":"18979","type":"Chemical","text":["Alpha-lipoic

The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling.

There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg\/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg\/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +\/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +\/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these

Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months. Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30% and in LDL-cholesterol of 40% in clinical studies. Modest increases in HDL-cholesterol levels of about 10% are also reported. Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences. Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term (up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential. One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued. Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients. Myopathy, associated in some cases with myoglobinuria, and in 2 cases with transient renal failure, has been rarely reported with lovastatin, especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin, gemfibrozil or niacin.

Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and\/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery."],"offsets":[[107,2017]]}],"entities":[{"id":"19482","type":"Chemical","text":["fentanyl"],"offsets":[[9,17]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005283"}]},{"id":"19483","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[26,32]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"19484","type":"Disease","text":["vomiting"],"offsets":[[37,45]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014839"}]},{"id":"19485","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[66,70]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"19486","type":"Chemical","text":["sevoflurane"],"offsets":[[78,89]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C009250"}]},{"id":"19487","type":"Chemical","text":["sevoflurane"],"offsets":[[201,212]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C009250"}]},{"id":"19488","type":"Disease","text":["postoperative

The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities in mice. Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg\/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg\/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg\/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP) (15 mg\/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy. Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg\/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05). However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP (15 mg\/kg i.p.). RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but THP (15 mg\/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters. On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg\/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg i.c.v.) could partially reverse such effects of THP (3.75 mg\/kg i.p.). Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP. Such an effect was, however, reversed in presence of RAMH. THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine-induced climbing in mice.

Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg\/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg\/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg\/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this

Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg\/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg\/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams.

They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments. The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling). Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures in male, Swiss-Webster mice. Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg\/kg cocaine for 5 days. All of these positive GABA(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling. Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling.

These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg\/kg\/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg\/kg\/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg\/kg\/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better

Intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with more inflammation than ischemic stroke. We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan, which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain damage, in a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus. Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of fucoidan (30 micrograms h-1) or vehicle. The hematoma was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor behavior, passive avoidance, and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks. Fucoidan-treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired blood clotting and hemodilution, had larger hematomas, and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days.

Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be so, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9, with hepatotoxicity being more common in women. The average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days. None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. The results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 (63%); the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months.

Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%. Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min. Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, aceto-acetate\/3-hydroxybutyrate) and clinical hepatic function parameters. AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B. In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation.

Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls.

Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart. These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment. In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP\/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats.

VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg\/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg\/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg\/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg\/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals.

With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg\/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U\/L (reference range, 10-37 U\/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U\/L (10-40 U\/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U\/L (0-270 U\/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U\/L (7-49 U\/L); amylase, 46 U\/L (0-220 U\/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg\/dL (0.2-1.0 mg\/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg\/dL (0-0.3 mg\/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg\/dL (3.5-5.4 mg\/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of \"acute hepatitis of unknown origin,\" that occurred after telithromycin usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin."],"offsets":[[56,1975]]}],"entities":[{"id":"20810","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis"],"offsets":[[6,15]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"20811","type":"Chemical","text":["telithromycin"],"offsets":[[41,54]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C106791"}]},{"id":"20812","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[92,106]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"20813","type":"Disease","text":["hepatic

Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq\/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg\/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers."],"offsets":[[92,1893]]}],"entities":[{"id":"20896","type":"Chemical","text":["Spironolactone"],"offsets":[[0,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013148"}]},{"id":"20897","type":"Disease","text":["renal

Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg\/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication."],"offsets":[[151,2779]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21030","type":"Disease","text":["End-stage renal

We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg\/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg\/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DBP reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n\/N=25\/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n\/N=9\/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n\/N=62\/92 and 14\/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. For low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive.

However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal. Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine. Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs. METHODS: Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose, 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose, or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose. All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy. Details of spinal puncture, extension and regression of spinal block, and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted. In the evening of postoperative day 1, patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure. RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs, 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs. Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine (150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min, respectively) but prolonged after bupivacaine (200 and 299 min, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs."],"offsets":[[126,1917]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21147","type":"Disease","text":["Transient neurologic

Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures."],"offsets":[[64,1093]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21311","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[12,20]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21312","type":"Disease","text":["cardiovascular disease"],"offsets":[[40,62]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002318"}]},{"id":"21313","type":"Chemical","text":["Nicotine"],"offsets":[[64,72]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21314","type":"Disease","text":["cardiovascular disease"],"offsets":[[150,172]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002318"}]},{"id":"21315","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[227,235]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21316","type":"Disease","text":["atherosclerosis"],"offsets":[[270,285]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D050197"}]},{"id":"21317","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[388,396]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21318","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[524,532]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21319","type":"Chemical","text":["carbon monoxide"],"offsets":[[631,646]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002248"}]},{"id":"21320","type":"Chemical","text":["Nicotine"],"offsets":[[648,656]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21321","type":"Disease","text":["thrombosis"],"offsets":[[684,694]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013927"}]},{"id":"21322","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[771,779]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21323","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[820,828]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21324","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[947,955]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"21325","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[995,1003]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"21326","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21311","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21327","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21311","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21328","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21313","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21329","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21313","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21330","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21315","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21331","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21315","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21332","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21317","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21333","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21317","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21334","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21318","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21335","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21318","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21336","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21320","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21337","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21320","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21338","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21322","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21339","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21322","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21340","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21323","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21341","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21323","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21342","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21324","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21343","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21324","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21344","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21325","arg2_id":"21312","normalized":[]},{"id":"21345","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21325","arg2_id":"21314","normalized":[]},{"id":"21346","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21311","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21347","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21313","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21348","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21315","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21349","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21317","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21350","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21318","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21351","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21320","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21352","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21322","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21353","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21323","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21354","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21324","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]},{"id":"21355","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21325","arg2_id":"21316","normalized":[]}]}

CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt. After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, venlafaxine was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure. Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted.

Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones. Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight. In the remaining 12 patients, localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units (values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich, dissolvable stones). Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided, fine needle puncture from six patients. All six patients had supersaturated bile (mean (SEM) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 (0.08) (range 1.01-1.53)) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol microcrystal nucleation times (< 4 days (range 1-4)), whilst in four, the bile contained cholesterol microcrystals immediately after sampling. Of the 12 patients considered for oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on UDCA while one was lost to follow up. After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich. This corresponds, by actuarial (life table) analysis, to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 (15.9%). In conclusion, octreotide induced gall stones are generally small, multiple, and cholesterol rich although, in common with spontaneous gall stone disease, at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium."],"offsets":[[102,1936]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21513","type":"Disease","text":["gall bladder

One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly. Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells. Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased. These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules. At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls. The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae. Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells. However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells.

This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae. We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BE), to cause seizures. Two separate equimolar doses (0.2 and 0.4 mumol) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats. Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence, latency, and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seizures. BE-Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine. Whereas cocaine-induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death, those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death. Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expression. BE-Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine-injected animals without seizures.

Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg\/kg (i.p.) dose of (+\/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 (a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). The protective effect of LY274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg\/kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by LY274614. The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor

METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis

Forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P).

There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G.

Our findings, showing no interaction between capsaicin treatment and attentional modulation suggest that capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia and attention might affect mechanical pain through independent mechanisms."],"offsets":[[96,831]]}],"entities":[{"id":"22353","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[36,40]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"22354","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[54,63]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"22355","type":"Disease","text":["hyperalgesia"],"offsets":[[82,94]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006930"}]},{"id":"22356","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[106,110]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"22357","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[182,186]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"22358","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[234,243]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"22359","type":"Disease","text":["hyperalgesia"],"offsets":[[262,274]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006930"}]},{"id":"22360","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[304,308]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"22361","type":"Disease","text":["hyperalgesia"],"offsets":[[332,344]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006930"}]},{"id":"22362","type":"Disease","text":["hyperalgesia"],"offsets":[[531,543]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006930"}]},{"id":"22363","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[571,580]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"22364","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[656,665]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"22365","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[716,725]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"22366","type":"Disease","text":["hyperalgesia"],"offsets":[[744,756]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006930"}]},{"id":"22367","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[795,799]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"22368","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22354","arg2_id":"22355","normalized":[]},{"id":"22369","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22354","arg2_id":"22359","normalized":[]},{"id":"22370","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22354","arg2_id":"22361","normalized":[]},{"id":"22371","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22354","arg2_id":"22362","normalized":[]},{"id":"22372","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22354","arg2_id":"22366","normalized":[]},{"id":"22373","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22358","arg2_id":"22355","normalized":[]},{"id":"22374","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22358","arg2_id":"22359","normalized":[]},{"id":"22375","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22358","arg2_id":"22361","normalized":[]},{"id":"22376","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22358","arg2_id":"22362","normalized":[]},{"id":"22377","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22358","arg2_id":"22366","normalized":[]},{"id":"22378","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22363","arg2_id":"22355","normalized":[]},{"id":"22379","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22363","arg2_id":"22359","normalized":[]},{"id":"22380","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22363","arg2_id":"22361","normalized":[]},{"id":"22381","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22363","arg2_id":"22362","normalized":[]},{"id":"22382","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22363","arg2_id":"22366","normalized":[]},{"id":"22383","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22364","arg2_id":"22355","normalized":[]},{"id":"22384","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22364","arg2_id":"22359","normalized":[]},{"id":"22385","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22364","arg2_id":"22361","normalized":[]},{"id":"22386","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22364","arg2_id":"22362","normalized":[]},{"id":"22387","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22364","arg2_id":"22366","normalized":[]},{"id":"22388","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22365","arg2_id":"22355","normalized":[]},{"id":"22389","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22365","arg2_id":"22359","normalized":[]},{"id":"22390","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22365","arg2_id":"22361","normalized":[]},{"id":"22391","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22365","arg2_id":"22362","normalized":[]},{"id":"22392","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22365","arg2_id":"22366","normalized":[]}]}

Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced.

Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng\/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir

MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose."],"offsets":[[168,2840]]}],"entities":[{"id":"22592","type":"Disease","text":["seizure"],"offsets":[[90,97]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"22593","type":"Chemical","text":["phenytoin"],"offsets":[[861,870]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010672"}]},{"id":"22594","type":"Chemical","text":["pilocarpine"],"offsets":[[1987,1998]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010862"}]},{"id":"22595","type":"Disease","text":["seizures"],"offsets":[[2007,2015]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"22596","type":"Chemical","text":["phenobarbital"],"offsets":[[2104,2117]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010634"}]},{"id":"22597","type":"Chemical","text":["tariquidar"],"offsets":[[2150,2160]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C402343"}]},{"id":"22598","type":"Disease","text":["injury to the brain"],"offsets":[[2457,2476]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001927"}]},{"id":"22599","type":"Disease","text":["seizures"],"offsets":[[2784,2792]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"22600","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22594","arg2_id":"22592","normalized":[]},{"id":"22601","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22594","arg2_id":"22595","normalized":[]},{"id":"22602","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22594","arg2_id":"22599","normalized":[]}]}

In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. In the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature

METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.

We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos. We observed the exencephaly induced by 5-azacytidine at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5. We confirmed several cases of transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly. However, in many cases, the exencephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period. To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the exencephaly by size and shape of the exencephalic tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5. It was found that the transformation of exencephalic tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of anencephaly at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of exencephalic tissue at E13.5. Microscopic observation showed the configuration of exencephaly at E13.5, frequent hemorrhaging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the exencephalic head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the exencephalic tissue at E18.5. From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the exencephalic head. These findings suggest that overgrowth of the exencephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and\/or hemorrhaging in various parts of the exencephalic head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from exencephaly to anencephaly."],"offsets":[[192,1966]]}],"entities":[{"id":"22875","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[27,38]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22876","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[164,175]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22877","type":"Disease","text":["anencephaly"],"offsets":[[179,190]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000757"}]},{"id":"22878","type":"Disease","text":["Anencephaly"],"offsets":[[192,203]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000757"}]},{"id":"22879","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[239,250]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22880","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[543,554]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22881","type":"Chemical","text":["5-azacytidine"],"offsets":[[566,579]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001374"}]},{"id":"22882","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[751,762]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22883","type":"Disease","text":["anencephaly"],"offsets":[[766,777]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000757"}]},{"id":"22884","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[807,819]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22885","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[953,964]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22886","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[990,1002]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22887","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1089,1101]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22888","type":"Disease","text":["anencephaly"],"offsets":[[1157,1168]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000757"}]},{"id":"22889","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1223,1235]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22890","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[1305,1316]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22891","type":"Disease","text":["hemorrhaging"],"offsets":[[1336,1348]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006470"}]},{"id":"22892","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1413,1425]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22893","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1480,1492]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22894","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1612,1624]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22895","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1677,1689]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22896","type":"Disease","text":["circulatory failure"],"offsets":[[1779,1798]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012769"}]},{"id":"22897","type":"Disease","text":["hemorrhaging"],"offsets":[[1806,1818]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006470"}]},{"id":"22898","type":"Disease","text":["exencephalic"],"offsets":[[1843,1855]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22899","type":"Disease","text":["exencephaly"],"offsets":[[1939,1950]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009436"}]},{"id":"22900","type":"Disease","text":["anencephaly"],"offsets":[[1954,1965]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000757"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"22901","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22881","arg2_id":"22877","normalized":[]},{"id":"22902","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22881","arg2_id":"22878","normalized":[]},{"id":"22903","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22881","arg2_id":"22883","normalized":[]},{"id":"22904","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22881","arg2_id":"22888","normalized":[]},{"id":"22905","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22881","arg2_id":"22900","normalized":[]}]}

These were the albino Sprague-Dawley ICR and BALB\/C, the black C57BL\/6 and the brown CDF-I mouse strains. Amantadine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility. The initial dose of amantadine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB\/C mice being the most sensitive. Subsequent amantadine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB\/C mice being the least sensitive. The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug-free period following the fourth amantadine treatment. Readministration of amantadine, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB\/C mice where suppression of motility occurred. Treatment with amantadine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the BALB\/C mice compared to saline control. Conversely, brain normetanephrine concentration was increased from saline control by amantadine in the BALB\/C mice. The results suggest a strain-dependent effect of amantadine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used. The BALB\/C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amantadine. The biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of BALB\/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and\/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in

Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +\/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg\/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms\/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms\/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +\/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +\/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).

The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. During the infusion of aminophylline, the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were kept within normal limits. When respiratory failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level.

We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100\/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg\/l carbachol, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg\/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. Especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure."],"offsets":[[57,2524]]}],"entities":[{"id":"23262","type":"Chemical","text":["carbachol"],"offsets":[[33,42]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002217"}]},{"id":"23263","type":"Chemical","text":["carbachol"],"offsets":[[90,99]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002217"}]},{"id":"23264","type":"Disease","text":["poisoning"],"offsets":[[212,221]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011041"}]},{"id":"23265","type":"Disease","text":["Alzheimer's

This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg\/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy. Of patients expressing a preference (89.1%), more than twice as many preferred rizatriptan to ergotamine\/caffeine (69.9 vs. 30.1%, p < or = 0.001). Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine\/caffeine. The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan. Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan, compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine\/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment. Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine\/caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine\/caffeine within 30 min of dosing. Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine\/caffeine (p < or = 0.001). Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine\/caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea, vomiting, phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001). More patients were (completely, very or somewhat) satisfied 2 h after treatment with rizatriptan (69.8%) than at 2 h after treatment with ergotamine\/caffeine (38.6%, p < or = 0.001). Recurrence rates were 31.4% with rizatriptan and 15.3% with ergotamine\/caffeine. Both active treatments were well tolerated.

METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock.

METHODS: The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto. RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia. Pretreatment with L-NOArg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140. It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine. Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des-Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy. In streptozotocin-induced hyperalgesia, inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin, whereas in vincristine-induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway. Therefore, concomitant administration of small doses of bradykinin receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of neuropathic pain, even in hospital

In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients.

We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine.

(+\/-)-PG-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished.

Affinity profiles of (+\/-)-PG-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4\/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+\/-)-PG-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels.

The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. Vehicle\/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these

Both, production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices. The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model. Treatment with 150 mg\/kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. Administration of 50 mg\/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Low-dose PDTC treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex. A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and PDTC-treated rats following status epilepticus. In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss. These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in seizure-associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus. However, future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which PDTC exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex."],"offsets":[[102,1790]]}],"entities":[{"id":"24504","type":"Chemical","text":["Pyrrolidine

The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label-restricted diseases. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adult smokers with heart disease, hypertension not controlled by medication, and\/or diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the 4-mg nicotine lozenge or 4-mg nicotine gum. Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use. RESULTS: Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum (safety population). The majority were women (52.7%). Patients' mean age was 53.9 years, their mean weight was 193.9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day at baseline. Five hundred fifty-three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for > or =4 days per week during the first 2 weeks (evaluable population). The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge. The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively). Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum. The most common adverse events were nausea (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), hiccups (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and headache (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6). Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups. Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study. The majority of patients (>60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline. CONCLUSION: The 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label-restricted medical conditions."],"offsets":[[166,2674]]}],"entities":[{"id":"24552","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[20,28]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24553","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[59,67]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24554","type":"Chemical","text":["Nicotine"],"offsets":[[178,186]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24555","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[231,239]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24556","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[274,282]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24557","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[313,321]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24558","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[505,513]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24559","type":"Chemical","text":["nicotine"],"offsets":[[531,539]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009538"}]},{"id":"24560","type":"Disease","text":["heart

Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs. Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP-induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs. Monkeys with acute (short-term) MPTP exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration. In contrast, monkeys with long-term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and\/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration). All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug.

METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis, fever, and glomerulonephritis developed. Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done, and a pericardial biopsy was performed. RESULTS: A 25-year-old woman with Graves' disease had a febrile illness and evidence of pericarditis, which was confirmed by biopsy. Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) against myeloperoxidase (MPO). Propylthiouracil therapy was withdrawn, and she was treated with a 1-month course of prednisone, which alleviated her symptoms. A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti-MPO pANCA-positive vasculitis associated with propylthio- uracil therapy. CONCLUSION: Pericarditis may be the initial manifestation of drug-induced vasculitis attributable to propylthio- uracil

Pain intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale; nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, and dry mouth, using a scale from 0 to 3 (not at all, slight, a lot, awful); Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (0-30); and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs (T0) and after 30 minutes (T30), 60 minutes (T60), 120 minutes (T120), and 180 minutes (T180). Ketamine, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses. This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay. Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire, gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng.\/ml. Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results. Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination. Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire, small testes and gynecomastia. Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. RESULTS: Testosterone was less than 3 ng.\/ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination. The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older). Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination. Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%). Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy. Prolactin exceeded 20 ng.\/ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination. Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered. These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng.\/ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, prolactinomas in 7, 0.38%). Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng.\/ml. (8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng.\/ml.). Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng.\/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination. However, cost-effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors. We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years. Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire, gynecomastia and\/or testosterone less than 4 ng.\/ml."],"offsets":[[111,3292]]}],"entities":[{"id":"24911","type":"Disease","text":["erectile

Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms\/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA\/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg\/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg\/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg\/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg\/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg\/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg\/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS).

In one patient, the tinnitus was almost completely abolished, but in all the nine patients the decompensated tinnitus changed to a compensated one. We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs, acupuncture and biofeedback, with disappointing results.

The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg\/kg of morphine-HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice. The morphine-induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine. In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine. Pretreatment of mice with alpha-methyltyrosine (20 mg\/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of morphine. On the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 X 320 mg\/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity. The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of morphine are mediated by the release of catecholamines from adrenergic neurons in the brain. And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine acts by retarding the release of acetylcholine at some central cholinergic synapses. It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of morphine in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of morphine in rats."],"offsets":[[89,1431]]}],"entities":[{"id":"25287","type":"Chemical","text":["morphine"],"offsets":[[32,40]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009020"}]},{"id":"25288","type":"Disease","text":["increase

The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+\/-13 to 152+\/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI. The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR (150 mg twice daily, 117) or placebo (twice daily, 117) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF; the primary outcome measure), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) (secondary outcome measures). Participants were followed biweekly during study period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean (sd) scores for CGI-SF were significantly lower, i.e. better, in patients on bupropion SR, at 2.4 (1.2), than in the placebo group, at 3.9 (1.1) (P= 0.01). Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score (54.4% vs 1.2%; P= 0.003), and in the five different domains of the IIEF. Total ASEX scores were significantly lower, i.e. better, among men who received bupropion than placebo, at 15.5 (4.3) vs 21.5 (4.7) (P= 0.002). The EDITS scores were 67.4 (10.2) for the bupropion and 36.3 (11.7) for the placebo group (P= 0.001). The ASEX score and CGI-SF score were correlated (P= 0.003). In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD, type of SSRI used and age.

Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation. In this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine. The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT. Two groups were compared in this study. The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment. The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine. They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT. The outcomes were compared for both groups. Of our control group (n= 50), 21 patients (42%) were established hepatitis. Twelve (24%) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis. In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006). Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group; 154:64 (p < 0.32).

Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect. Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine (10 mg\/kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and Rg1 (30 mg\/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days. Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze. The results showed that rats treated with Morphine\/Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency. By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that Rg1 restored the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats. The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or morphine\/Rg1-treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK801. We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine-inhibited LTP.

BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented. DESIGN: This study was designed as within-subject, quasi-experimental research. METHOD: The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered. Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site. Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection. Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop-watch was used to time the pain period. Data were analysed using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation. RESULTS: The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection. It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30-second injection. Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30-second injection than for the 10-second injection. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin. This study should be repeated on a larger sample. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: When administering subcutaneous heparin injections, it is important to extend the duration of the

In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg\/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg\/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in

Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections. The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM), and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM-induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose.

Although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased. All three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were abnormal. During monitoring, visual hallucinations did not correlate with EEG readings, nor did video recording capture any of the described events.

This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process. To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of glomerular injury, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat. Puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN, 20 mg\/100g BW). Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126). At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +\/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles\/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +\/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles\/glomerulus, p < 0.005). This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +\/- 1 to 99.0 +\/- 61 mg\/day (p < 0.001). In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time. By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline. By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal. We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by PAN.

Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box. Dopamine turnover ratios (DOPAC:DA and HVA:DA) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts. However, apomorphine-induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments. The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents."],"offsets":[[71,1746]]}],"entities":[{"id":"26103","type":"Chemical","text":["Apomorphine"],"offsets":[[296,307]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26104","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine agonist"],"offsets":[[324,340]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018491"}]},{"id":"26105","type":"Disease","text":["hypothermia"],"offsets":[[417,428]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007035"}]},{"id":"26106","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[465,473]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"26107","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[583,594]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26108","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[699,710]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26109","type":"Disease","text":["hyperactivity"],"offsets":[[719,732]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006948"}]},{"id":"26110","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[879,890]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26111","type":"Disease","text":["hypothermia"],"offsets":[[912,923]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007035"}]},{"id":"26112","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[934,945]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26113","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1236,1247]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26114","type":"Chemical","text":["Dopamine"],"offsets":[[1316,1324]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"26115","type":"Chemical","text":["DOPAC"],"offsets":[[1342,1347]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015102"}]},{"id":"26116","type":"Chemical","text":["DA"],"offsets":[[1348,1350]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018491"}]},{"id":"26117","type":"Chemical","text":["HVA"],"offsets":[[1355,1358]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006719"}]},{"id":"26118","type":"Chemical","text":["DA"],"offsets":[[1359,1361]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018491"}]},{"id":"26119","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1490,1501]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"26120","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[1533,1541]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"26121","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26103","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26122","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26103","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26123","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26107","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26124","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26107","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26125","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26108","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26126","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26108","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26127","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26110","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26128","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26110","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26129","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26112","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26130","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26112","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26131","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26113","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26132","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26113","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26133","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26119","arg2_id":"26105","normalized":[]},{"id":"26134","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26119","arg2_id":"26111","normalized":[]},{"id":"26135","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26103","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26136","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26107","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26137","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26108","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26138","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26110","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26139","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26112","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26140","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26113","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]},{"id":"26141","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26119","arg2_id":"26109","normalized":[]}]}
