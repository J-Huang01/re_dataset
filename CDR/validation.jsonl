The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy. However, dP\/dt in the ISO-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA.

Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg\/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg\/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg\/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways.

AIM: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. RESULTS: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure.

The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele\/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively.

This is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg\/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg\/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg\/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg\/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel."],"offsets":[[105,1863]]}],"entities":[{"id":"749","type":"Chemical","text":["bupropion

After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU\/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands.

AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies. Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved. METHODS\/MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed. Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007. RESULTS: Since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1). The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (P = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (P < 0.001). Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of bradycardia, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies. While use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae. Dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI."],"offsets":[[66,2042]]}],"entities":[{"id":"908","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[10,25]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"909","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[149,164]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"910","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[276,291]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"911","type":"Chemical","text":["Dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[371,386]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"912","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[548,563]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"913","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[816,831]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"914","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[932,947]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"915","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1200,1215]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"916","type":"Chemical","text":["pentobarbital"],"offsets":[[1293,1306]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010424"}]},{"id":"917","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1345,1360]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"918","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1436,1451]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"919","type":"Disease","text":["bradycardia"],"offsets":[[1500,1511]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001919"}]},{"id":"920","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[1608,1614]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]},{"id":"921","type":"Chemical","text":["Dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1659,1674]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"922","type":"Chemical","text":["dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1766,1781]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]},{"id":"923","type":"Chemical","text":["Dexmedetomidine"],"offsets":[[1977,1992]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020927"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"924","type":"CID","arg1_id":"908","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"925","type":"CID","arg1_id":"909","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"926","type":"CID","arg1_id":"910","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"927","type":"CID","arg1_id":"911","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"928","type":"CID","arg1_id":"912","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"929","type":"CID","arg1_id":"913","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"930","type":"CID","arg1_id":"914","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"931","type":"CID","arg1_id":"915","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"932","type":"CID","arg1_id":"917","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"933","type":"CID","arg1_id":"918","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"934","type":"CID","arg1_id":"921","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"935","type":"CID","arg1_id":"922","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]},{"id":"936","type":"CID","arg1_id":"923","arg2_id":"919","normalized":[]}]}

METHODS: This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed. RESULTS: Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+\/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+\/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+\/-2.3; range 92 to 99). The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+\/-14.4; range 33 to 91). The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0). The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8). The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+\/-2.4; range 84 to 98). The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3). All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol. The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+\/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words. Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia."],"offsets":[[93,2889]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1104","type":"Disease","text":["amnesia"],"offsets":[[43,50]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000647"}]},{"id":"1105","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[83,91]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"1106","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[220,228]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"1107","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[461,469]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"1108","type":"Disease","text":["inability to repeat words"],"offsets":[[1967,1992]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000647"}]},{"id":"1109","type":"Disease","text":["retrograde amnesia"],"offsets":[[2870,2888]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000648"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"1110","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1105","arg2_id":"1104","normalized":[]},{"id":"1111","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1105","arg2_id":"1108","normalized":[]},{"id":"1112","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1106","arg2_id":"1104","normalized":[]},{"id":"1113","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1106","arg2_id":"1108","normalized":[]},{"id":"1114","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1107","arg2_id":"1104","normalized":[]},{"id":"1115","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1107","arg2_id":"1108","normalized":[]}]}

RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high. Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants. All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination. The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest. Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%). In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women. CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement."],"offsets":[[96,1801]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1119","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[24,35]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1120","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[40,47]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1121","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[164,175]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1122","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[180,187]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1123","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[429,440]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1124","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[445,452]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1125","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[476,487]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1126","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[541,552]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1127","type":"Chemical","text":["hepatitis B surface antigen"],"offsets":[[597,624]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006514"}]},{"id":"1128","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[643,650]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1129","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[706,713]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1130","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[725,732]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1131","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[788,799]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1132","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[812,819]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1133","type":"Disease","text":["Hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[839,850]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1134","type":"Chemical","text":["hepatitis B surface antigen"],"offsets":[[941,968]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006514"}]},{"id":"1135","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[1000,1011]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1136","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[1151,1162]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1137","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[1466,1473]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1138","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[1517,1524]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]},{"id":"1139","type":"Disease","text":["hepatitis B"],"offsets":[[1719,1730]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006509"}]},{"id":"1140","type":"Disease","text":["rubella"],"offsets":[[1735,1742]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012409"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"1141","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1119","normalized":[]},{"id":"1142","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1121","normalized":[]},{"id":"1143","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1123","normalized":[]},{"id":"1144","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1125","normalized":[]},{"id":"1145","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1126","normalized":[]},{"id":"1146","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1131","normalized":[]},{"id":"1147","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1133","normalized":[]},{"id":"1148","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1135","normalized":[]},{"id":"1149","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1136","normalized":[]},{"id":"1150","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1127","arg2_id":"1139","normalized":[]},{"id":"1151","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1119","normalized":[]},{"id":"1152","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1121","normalized":[]},{"id":"1153","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1123","normalized":[]},{"id":"1154","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1125","normalized":[]},{"id":"1155","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1126","normalized":[]},{"id":"1156","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1131","normalized":[]},{"id":"1157","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1133","normalized":[]},{"id":"1158","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1135","normalized":[]},{"id":"1159","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1136","normalized":[]},{"id":"1160","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1134","arg2_id":"1139","normalized":[]}]}

We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions. METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose. Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia. All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age. Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components. Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion. RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased citrate synthase activity. In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased. In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity. Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I. Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes. Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin-induced renal lesions."],"offsets":[[93,2050]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1181","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[70,81]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"1182","type":"Disease","text":["nephrosis"],"offsets":[[82,91]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009401"}]},{"id":"1183","type":"Chemical","text":["Doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[105,116]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"1184","type":"Disease","text":["nephropathy"],"offsets":[[145,156]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1185","type":"Disease","text":["glomerular and late-onset tubular lesions"],"offsets":[[180,221]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1186","type":"Disease","text":["mitochondrial injury"],"offsets":[[269,289]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D028361"}]},{"id":"1187","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[365,376]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"1188","type":"Disease","text":["Glomerular and tubular injury"],"offsets":[[634,663]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1189","type":"Chemical","text":["superoxide"],"offsets":[[833,843]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013481"}]},{"id":"1190","type":"Disease","text":["glomerular and tubular lesions"],"offsets":[[950,980]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1191","type":"Chemical","text":["citrate"],"offsets":[[1084,1091]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C102006"}]},{"id":"1192","type":"Disease","text":["tubular lesions"],"offsets":[[1254,1269]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1193","type":"Disease","text":["glomerular lesions"],"offsets":[[1294,1312]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1194","type":"Disease","text":["glomerular and tubular injury"],"offsets":[[1342,1371]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1195","type":"Chemical","text":["superoxide"],"offsets":[[1576,1586]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013481"}]},{"id":"1196","type":"Chemical","text":["superoxide"],"offsets":[[2002,2012]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013481"}]},{"id":"1197","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[2016,2027]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"1198","type":"Disease","text":["renal lesions"],"offsets":[[2036,2049]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"1199","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1181","arg2_id":"1182","normalized":[]},{"id":"1200","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1183","arg2_id":"1182","normalized":[]},{"id":"1201","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1187","arg2_id":"1182","normalized":[]},{"id":"1202","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1197","arg2_id":"1182","normalized":[]}]}

CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine. Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration. DISCUSSION: AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. tobramycin (4 mg\/kg\/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of tobramycin and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. Tobramycin serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. Trough concentrations were < 2 g\/ml in the two groups (100%). Peak concentrations were > 6 microg\/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01). Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+\/-2.89 microg\/ml in OD vs. 6.53+\/-1.45 microg\/ml in TD (P< 0.01). The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+\/-0.03\/h in OD vs. 0.24+\/-0.06\/h in TD), t1\/2, (4.95+\/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+\/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+\/-0.11 l\/kg in OD vs. 0.33+\/-0.09 l\/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+\/-0.29 ml\/min\/kg in OD vs. 1.28+\/-0.33 ml\/min\/kg in TD). Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity. In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg\/ml."],"offsets":[[91,2133]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1320","type":"Chemical","text":["tobramycin"],"offsets":[[31,41]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]},{"id":"1321","type":"Chemical","text":["tobramicyn"],"offsets":[[175,185]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]},{"id":"1322","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[227,235]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"1323","type":"Chemical","text":["tobramycin"],"offsets":[[300,310]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]},{"id":"1324","type":"Chemical","text":["tobramycin"],"offsets":[[404,414]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]},{"id":"1325","type":"Chemical","text":["Tobramycin"],"offsets":[[490,500]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]},{"id":"1326","type":"Chemical","text":["creatinine"],"offsets":[[1478,1488]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003404"}]},{"id":"1327","type":"Disease","text":["nephrotoxicity"],"offsets":[[1577,1591]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"1328","type":"Disease","text":["decreased auditory function"],"offsets":[[1631,1658]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D034381"}]},{"id":"1329","type":"Disease","text":["auditory loss"],"offsets":[[1691,1704]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D034381"}]},{"id":"1330","type":"Disease","text":["decreased auditory function"],"offsets":[[1767,1794]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D034381"}]},{"id":"1331","type":"Chemical","text":["tobramycin"],"offsets":[[1870,1880]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014031"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"1332","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1320","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1333","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1320","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1334","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1320","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]},{"id":"1335","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1321","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1336","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1321","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1337","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1321","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]},{"id":"1338","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1323","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1339","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1323","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1340","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1323","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]},{"id":"1341","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1324","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1342","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1324","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1343","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1324","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]},{"id":"1344","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1325","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1345","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1325","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1346","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1325","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]},{"id":"1347","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1331","arg2_id":"1328","normalized":[]},{"id":"1348","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1331","arg2_id":"1329","normalized":[]},{"id":"1349","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1331","arg2_id":"1330","normalized":[]}]}

METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal (\"off\" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens (\"on\" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy."],"offsets":[[67,2218]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1416","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[46,65]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"1417","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[179,198]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"1418","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[319,338]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"1419","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1009,1020]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"1420","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1121,1132]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"1421","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1217,1228]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"1422","type":"Disease","text":["parkinsonism"],"offsets":[[1265,1277]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"1423","type":"Disease","text":["bradykinesia"],"offsets":[[1293,1305]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018476"}]},{"id":"1424","type":"Disease","text":["rigidity"],"offsets":[[1311,1319]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009127"}]},{"id":"1425","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1408,1419]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"1426","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[1847,1866]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"1427","type":"Chemical","text":["levodopa"],"offsets":[[1902,1910]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"1428","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1919,1930]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"1429","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1427","arg2_id":"1419","normalized":[]},{"id":"1430","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1427","arg2_id":"1420","normalized":[]},{"id":"1431","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1427","arg2_id":"1421","normalized":[]},{"id":"1432","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1427","arg2_id":"1425","normalized":[]},{"id":"1433","type":"CID","arg1_id":"1427","arg2_id":"1428","normalized":[]}]}

The pilocarpine (PILO) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage. We report peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model. PILO-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells. NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and sensorimotor areas. In addition, PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls. The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the PILO model of TLE.

The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02).

However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature.

On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam.

CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years. He received a 10-day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation. He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function. Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug-induced acute liver injury. His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy. Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms. The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale. DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1\/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger

Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: Mannitol (18% solution; 1 g\/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP."],"offsets":[[116,1645]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2011","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[11,19]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2012","type":"Disease","text":["gliomas"],"offsets":[[42,49]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005910"}]},{"id":"2013","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[139,147]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2014","type":"Disease","text":["brain edema"],"offsets":[[158,169]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001929"}]},{"id":"2015","type":"Disease","text":["elevated ICP"],"offsets":[[180,192]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D019586"}]},{"id":"2016","type":"Disease","text":["brain tumor"],"offsets":[[196,207]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001932"}]},{"id":"2017","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[291,299]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2018","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[573,581]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2019","type":"Disease","text":["brain tumor"],"offsets":[[624,635]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001932"}]},{"id":"2020","type":"Chemical","text":["Mannitol"],"offsets":[[655,663]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2021","type":"Disease","text":["malignant glioma"],"offsets":[[736,752]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005910"}]},{"id":"2022","type":"Disease","text":["metastases"],"offsets":[[766,776]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009362"}]},{"id":"2023","type":"Disease","text":["meningioma"],"offsets":[[786,796]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008579"}]},{"id":"2024","type":"Disease","text":["edematous"],"offsets":[[880,889]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004487"}]},{"id":"2025","type":"Chemical","text":["Mannitol"],"offsets":[[962,970]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2026","type":"Disease","text":["glioma"],"offsets":[[1106,1112]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005910"}]},{"id":"2027","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[1123,1131]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2028","type":"Disease","text":["meningioma"],"offsets":[[1224,1234]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008579"}]},{"id":"2029","type":"Disease","text":["metastases"],"offsets":[[1239,1249]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009362"}]},{"id":"2030","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[1284,1292]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2031","type":"Chemical","text":["mannitol"],"offsets":[[1474,1482]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008353"}]},{"id":"2032","type":"Disease","text":["gliomas"],"offsets":[[1521,1528]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005910"}]},{"id":"2033","type":"Disease","text":["edema"],"offsets":[[1610,1615]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004487"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"2034","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2011","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2035","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2013","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2036","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2017","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2037","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2018","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2038","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2020","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2039","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2025","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2040","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2027","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2041","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2030","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]},{"id":"2042","type":"CID","arg1_id":"2031","arg2_id":"2015","normalized":[]}]}

Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (Group PS, LS) or rocuronium (Group PR) for tracheal intubation. Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. Twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05). A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers. All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy. Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results. Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s). RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%. Thirty-five patients (12%) clinically failed treatment. The microbiologic eradication rate (presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%. Microbiologic eradication rates (presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% (M. catarrhalis) to 100% (S. pneumoniae) at the post-therapy visit. All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post-therapy returned for a long-term follow-up visit; 243 (92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 (8%) had a relapse of symptoms. Adverse events considered to be related to levofloxacin administration were reported by 29 patients (9%).

Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT\/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +\/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +\/- 2.25 pmol).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg.

METHODS: Data were analyzed from four similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, 3- to 12-week studies. Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg\/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls. Two studies evaluated quetiapine (up to 800 mg\/day) in combination with a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex, QTP + Li\/DVP) (n = 196) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer (PBO + Li\/DVP) (n = 203). Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage. RESULTS: The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including akathisia, was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Similarly, EPS-related adverse events with QTP + Li\/DVP (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + Li\/DVP (19.2%). Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS. The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li\/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li\/DVP (4.9%). Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of tremor (18.4%) than quetiapine (5.6%); cerebellar tremor, which is a known adverse effect of lithium, may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy. Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of akathisia (33.3% versus 5.9%), tremor (30.3% versus 7.8%), and extrapyramidal syndrome (35.4% versus 5.9%) than quetiapine. No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores. Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo.

METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet. After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of clonidine. RESULTS: Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride-induced increase in MAP in both groups. Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) sodium chloride diet.

Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam. On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165\/90 and 130\/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms. Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU\/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU\/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU\/L), and BUN (27.9 mg\/ml) levels. The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU\/L). This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment. The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case.

METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >\/=0.5 mg\/dL (44 micromol\/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF. Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy."],"offsets":[[191,3060]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2934","type":"Disease","text":["decreased renal

Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders. The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis. CASE REPORT: Two, 3-year-old male, identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets. The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success. This was their first day of pemoline therapy. The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion. The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders. The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements. Despite treatment, the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours. Forty-eight hours after admission, the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home. CONCLUSION: Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature. The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline

Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels. Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept. Both verapamil (10 mg\/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol.

This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis. The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or iohexol (group B, n = 40). Serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use. Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals. Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population. Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with CIN, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, CIN is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in

Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. However, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol (EMB)-induced optic neuropathy of short-, intermediate-, and long-term visual deficits were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination. In addition, OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey-Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis protocol. OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL. RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n=661. In all subjects with history of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+\/-16 microm. There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the (six) eyes of all three subjects (mean average thickness of 55+\/-29 microm). In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies. OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies. Additionally, in terms of management of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached."],"offsets":[[107,2718]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3692","type":"Chemical","text":["ethambutol"],"offsets":[[70,80]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004977"}]},{"id":"3693","type":"Disease","text":["optic

We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib, a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial thrombotic) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) aspirin (n = 1051) and nonusers of aspirin (n = 6883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose. Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%). The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses. Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic

The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ([1R, 3S] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for SKF-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for A-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg\/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action.

Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa. Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist.

Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg\/kg) in rats. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol\/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol\/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol\/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar.

Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg\/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg\/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg\/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg\/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity.

We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention. For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered. Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +\/- 4.6 s). Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +\/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO, or delayed NTG (580 +\/- 81 s, 557 +\/- 67 s, and 493 +\/- 146 s, respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +\/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +\/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +\/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +\/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88.1 +\/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +\/- 2.9 mm Hg. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +\/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +\/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +\/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +\/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups, respectively. There were no significant differences among groups. CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect. NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension. The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups."],"offsets":[[97,2745]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4320","type":"Chemical","text":["Nimodipine"],"offsets":[[0,10]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009553"}]},{"id":"4321","type":"Disease","text":["memory

Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol. Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins. We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin. Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process. In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.

Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK\/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin\/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity. Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts. Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+\/-14.0 nmol\/min\/g heart in ND versus 400.2+\/-11.8 nmol\/min\/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP\/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration. Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK\/STAT3 pathway. In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK\/STAT3 pathway."],"offsets":[[89,2097]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4545","type":"Chemical","text":["fat"],"offsets":[[5,8]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004041"}]},{"id":"4546","type":"Disease","text":["obese"],"offsets":[[18,23]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009765"}]},{"id":"4547","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[53,64]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4548","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[73,87]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"4549","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[112,123]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4550","type":"Chemical","text":["Adriamycin"],"offsets":[[125,135]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4551","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[172,186]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"4552","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[306,317]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4553","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[326,340]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"4554","type":"Chemical","text":["triglycerides"],"offsets":[[421,434]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014280"}]},{"id":"4555","type":"Chemical","text":["ATP"],"offsets":[[479,482]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000255"}]},{"id":"4556","type":"Chemical","text":["fat"],"offsets":[[624,627]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004041"}]},{"id":"4557","type":"Disease","text":["obesity"],"offsets":[[654,661]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009765"}]},{"id":"4558","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[717,728]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4559","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[737,751]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"4560","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[773,784]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"4561","type":"Disease","text":["cardiotoxicity"],"offsets":[[857,871]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D066126"}]},{"id":"4562","type":"Disease","text":["cardiac

Subcutaneous injection of ISPH (200 mg\/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity. The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium. The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats. Upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg\/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels. Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH-induced MI rats.

DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double-blinded fashion with remifentanil 1 microg\/kg or placebo. Two minutes after remifentanil or placebo injection, etomidate 0.3 mg\/kg was given. MEASUREMENTS: Myoclonus was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3. The grade of sedation (none, mild, moderate, severe), nausea, pruritus, and apnea were recorded after injection of both drugs. MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group (6.7%) than in the placebo group (70%) (P < 0.001). None of the patients experienced sedation, apnea, nausea, or pruritus after injection of both drugs. In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration.

Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg\/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior). These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia."],"offsets":[[98,1406]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4853","type":"Chemical","text":["Daidzein"],"offsets":[[0,8]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4854","type":"Chemical","text":["choline"],"offsets":[[19,26]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002794"}]},{"id":"4855","type":"Disease","text":["amnesia"],"offsets":[[89,96]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000647"}]},{"id":"4856","type":"Chemical","text":["choline"],"offsets":[[102,109]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002794"}]},{"id":"4857","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylcholine"],"offsets":[[237,250]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]},{"id":"4858","type":"Chemical","text":["ACh"],"offsets":[[252,255]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]},{"id":"4859","type":"Disease","text":["Alzheimer's disease"],"offsets":[[301,320]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000544"}]},{"id":"4860","type":"Disease","text":["AD"],"offsets":[[322,324]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000544"}]},{"id":"4861","type":"Chemical","text":["daidzein"],"offsets":[[534,542]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4862","type":"Chemical","text":["4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone"],"offsets":[[544,569]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4863","type":"Chemical","text":["daidzein"],"offsets":[[611,619]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4864","type":"Chemical","text":["scopolamine"],"offsets":[[650,661]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012601"}]},{"id":"4865","type":"Disease","text":["impairments of learning and memory"],"offsets":[[670,704]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007859"},{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008569"}]},{"id":"4866","type":"Disease","text":["impairments of learning"],"offsets":[[670,693]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007859"}]},{"id":"4867","type":"Disease","text":["impairments of","memory"],"offsets":[[670,684],[698,704]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008569"}]},{"id":"4868","type":"Chemical","text":["daidzein"],"offsets":[[764,772]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4869","type":"Chemical","text":["scopolamine"],"offsets":[[840,851]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012601"}]},{"id":"4870","type":"Disease","text":["amnesia"],"offsets":[[860,867]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000647"}]},{"id":"4871","type":"Chemical","text":["scopolamine"],"offsets":[[926,937]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012601"}]},{"id":"4872","type":"Chemical","text":["daidzein"],"offsets":[[1078,1086]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4873","type":"Chemical","text":["scopolamine"],"offsets":[[1100,1111]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012601"}]},{"id":"4874","type":"Chemical","text":["daidzein"],"offsets":[[1271,1279]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004742"}]},{"id":"4875","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylcholine"],"offsets":[[1301,1314]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]},{"id":"4876","type":"Chemical","text":["scopolamine"],"offsets":[[1378,1389]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012601"}]},{"id":"4877","type":"Disease","text":["amnesia"],"offsets":[[1398,1405]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000647"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"4878","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4864","arg2_id":"4855","normalized":[]},{"id":"4879","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4864","arg2_id":"4870","normalized":[]},{"id":"4880","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4864","arg2_id":"4877","normalized":[]},{"id":"4881","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4869","arg2_id":"4855","normalized":[]},{"id":"4882","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4869","arg2_id":"4870","normalized":[]},{"id":"4883","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4869","arg2_id":"4877","normalized":[]},{"id":"4884","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4871","arg2_id":"4855","normalized":[]},{"id":"4885","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4871","arg2_id":"4870","normalized":[]},{"id":"4886","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4871","arg2_id":"4877","normalized":[]},{"id":"4887","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4873","arg2_id":"4855","normalized":[]},{"id":"4888","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4873","arg2_id":"4870","normalized":[]},{"id":"4889","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4873","arg2_id":"4877","normalized":[]},{"id":"4890","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4876","arg2_id":"4855","normalized":[]},{"id":"4891","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4876","arg2_id":"4870","normalized":[]},{"id":"4892","type":"CID","arg1_id":"4876","arg2_id":"4877","normalized":[]}]}

CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis. Hiccups were persistent and exhausting. Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups. No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation. DISCUSSION: Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug-induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination.

In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg\/kg\/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and\/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura."],"offsets":[[97,1662]]}],"entities":[{"id":"5045","type":"Chemical","text":["Glyceryl

Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent.

Nineteen patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same. The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. However, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine). Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine. Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy.

The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus. In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly. However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. Further, 5,7-DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal

A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine. This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers. METHOD: Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, anxiety, or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial. Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient. RESULTS: Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine. One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects. Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating, increased anxiety, and a wound-up feeling in some patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.

However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy.

Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups.

Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU\/kg\/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg\/kg\/i.v.). Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.

The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-\/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests.

METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng\/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng\/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield.

We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID. We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs. The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs. The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.

METHODS: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria. Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days. The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three. RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity. Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards. Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards). CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells.

The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown. To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor\/vascular permeability factor (VEGF\/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2\/Flk-1\/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF\/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. VEGF\/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. After 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF\/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1\/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure.

At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg\/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated.

Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged, systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg (SED +\/- 3.4, p less than 0.01), associated with an increased cardiac output (5.85-7.73 l\/min, SED +\/- 0.46, p less than 0.01).

The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra-arterial norepinephrine (25, 50, and 100 ng\/min) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone, increasing from an average of 14.9 +\/- 2.4 R units before treatment to 35.1 +\/- 5.5 R units after hydrocortisone (SED +\/- 6.0, p less than 0.05). A shift to the left in the dose-response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment. Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased.

Cocaine (40 mg\/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg\/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, \"beating drum\" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation.

Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species.

We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg\/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+\/-1.4 (mean+\/-SE) to 5.6+\/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+\/-17 to 82+\/-12 ml\/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+\/-0.11 ml\/s to 2.18+\/-0.21 muscle-lengths\/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism."],"offsets":[[190,2268]]}],"entities":[{"id":"6552","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[11,18]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6553","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[33,39]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]},{"id":"6554","type":"Disease","text":["coronary artery disease"],"offsets":[[83,106]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003324"}]},{"id":"6555","type":"Disease","text":["heart failure"],"offsets":[[175,188]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006333"}]},{"id":"6556","type":"Chemical","text":["digitalis glycosides"],"offsets":[[205,225]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004071"}]},{"id":"6557","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[240,246]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]},{"id":"6558","type":"Disease","text":["coronary artery disease"],"offsets":[[323,346]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003324"}]},{"id":"6559","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[421,428]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6560","type":"Disease","text":["coronary artery disease"],"offsets":[[543,566]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003324"}]},{"id":"6561","type":"Disease","text":["congestive heart failure"],"offsets":[[584,608]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006333"}]},{"id":"6562","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[779,786]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6563","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[924,931]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6564","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[1215,1222]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6565","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[1550,1556]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]},{"id":"6566","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[1584,1591]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6567","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[1686,1693]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6568","type":"Disease","text":["coronary artery disease"],"offsets":[[1775,1798]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003324"}]},{"id":"6569","type":"Disease","text":["congestive heart failure"],"offsets":[[1823,1847]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006333"}]},{"id":"6570","type":"Disease","text":["left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls"],"offsets":[[1848,1891]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002303"}]},{"id":"6571","type":"Chemical","text":["ouabain"],"offsets":[[1898,1905]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010042"}]},{"id":"6572","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[2055,2061]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]},{"id":"6573","type":"Chemical","text":["oxygen"],"offsets":[[2153,2159]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010100"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"6574","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6552","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6575","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6559","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6576","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6562","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6577","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6563","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6578","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6564","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6579","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6566","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6580","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6567","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]},{"id":"6581","type":"CID","arg1_id":"6571","arg2_id":"6570","normalized":[]}]}

We characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%). Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), IDDM (12), nephrotoxicity (3), GI toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (PTLD) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1). All early-conversion patients showed improvement\/resolution of symptoms. Among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement\/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted. The overall rejection rate was 30%. Sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +\/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion.

To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg\/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). Plasma and liver 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control. Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05). Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05). Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the study. The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14, while the levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout the study.

CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma.

The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN\/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy."],"offsets":[[93,3907]]}],"entities":[{"id":"7635","type":"Chemical","text":["ribavirin"],"offsets":[[12,21]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012254"}]},{"id":"7636","type":"Disease","text":["adenovirus

Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine.

Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration. METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21\/27 patients). Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities.

Daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. Co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect. Daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus. Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions. Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function.

The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.

METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg\/dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali syndrome. RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. No malignant lesion was found. Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide. The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia. Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of calcium carbonate. In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk-alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003. CONCLUSION: Milk-alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. Treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate. Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe

Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia (RIHA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA. Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g\/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317. In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459. CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170\/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse

In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin.

One hundred fifty-five subjects participated. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of spring allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the azelastine groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications. Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication. Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups. Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study.

The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67,580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48,968, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors. Intra-arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and\/or immediately below the urothelium. These tachykinins, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors.

Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol\/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.

On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of SIAT, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT. Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it."],"offsets":[[109,1512]]}],"entities":[{"id":"8863","type":"Disease","text":["atrial

Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure.

Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation. Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation. Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery. RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized. The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11\/57 [19%] vs 23\/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. The mean +\/- SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+\/-1.5 days vs 1.4+\/-4.0 days; P=.01). CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg\/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity.

In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.

Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)\/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH. Data on mid- and long-term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse.

Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040).

Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -\/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -\/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. However, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -\/- brains in comparison to KA.

Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature. These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth. We report the successful treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline. RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar disorder or psychoses, with risperidone-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng\/mL, normal 5-15 ng\/mL), were treated with cabergoline (mean dose 2.13 +\/- 0.09 mg\/week). When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects (mean 11.2 +\/- 10.9 ng\/mL), the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg\/week in three of four subjects. The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523.5 +\/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788.5 +\/- 162.5 days.

The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously. Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin. METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field. The eighth exhibited concentric constriction. Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave. However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials. Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.

METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (RAPA) (5 mg\/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+\/-34 to 210+\/-56 micromol\/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients. No relapse of PTLD was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. There were no deaths. RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one. RAPA levels were high (>15 ng\/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal.

Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks. At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy. In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes. Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies. Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg\/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and\/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment. Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver.

RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin.

Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [cisapride, 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups. In cisapride-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +\/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +\/- 2.6 mm Hg, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +\/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +\/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +\/- 0.2 sec, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +\/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +\/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +\/- 0.4 cont.\/min, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +\/- 1.1 cont.\/min] than patients treated with placebo. No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the constipation-predominant IBS group. Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +\/- 5 versus 67 +\/- 14 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +\/- 19 mm]. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [score, 55 +\/- 15 versus 34 +\/- 12 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +\/- 19 mm].

Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225-550 mg\/m2 (median dose 360). The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography. Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05). No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability. When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients. The incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose. Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted.

Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine-induced seizures. In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a digoxigenin-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals. Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl violet staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels. The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer. Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals. No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer. The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure-induced damage.

METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg\/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg\/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg\/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq\/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4\/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU\/kg\/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U\/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level. HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)\/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)\/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)\/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)\/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)\/L on POD 9, respectively. The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14.

Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg\/kg\/day. Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation. Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test. There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups. Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01). In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001). There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.

The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa. A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in Parkinson's disease + LID only. In Parkinson's disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05). An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition. In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson's disease - LID. Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in Parkinson's disease + LID than in Parkinson's disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups. Severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01). No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations.

A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX. Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria. Two hr post-injection, DXNP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5\/6 rats given DX died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg\/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX. Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free DX, despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former. Both effects (better survival and nephrosis) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg\/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome. Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-nephrotic stage (day 1-5) and nephrotic stage (day 6-11). In pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant. Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5). At the beginning of nephrotic stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern. Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9). Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g\/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g\/ml). In the pre-nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL

In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons. A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation. However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections.

Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg\/ml. AZT produced anaemia in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion. Despite the anaemia, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in AZT treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment. Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice. By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals. The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treated mice. The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia.

Using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg\/kg, once a week). There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. Myocardial accumulation of [125I]MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). In the 5-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). In the 8-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). Thus, MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner. The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a

Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"],"offsets":[[145,2510]]}],"entities":[{"id":"11610","type":"Disease","text":["Orthostatic

Bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored. When asystole was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun. Epinephrine 0.01 mg\/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied. Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine. The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine. The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups. However, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups. We conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest

A new vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22). The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion. Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT (0.03 microg\/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control. These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg\/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, OCT improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone

Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel 225 mg\/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia\/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be

The loading dose was 800 mg\/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg\/day. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +\/- standard deviation 14.2 +\/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41% and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). Although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients.

Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine. Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension, QRS prolongation, and bradycardia. Fifteen min later, animals received CaCl2, NaHCO3, or saline. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity.

Since cis-RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of cis-RA administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral cis-RA administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg\/m2\/d until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed. A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted. RESULTS: The MTD of cis-RA was 160 mg\/m2\/d. Dose-limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg\/m2\/d included hypercalcemia (n = 3), rash (n = 2), and anemia\/thrombocytopenia\/emesis\/rash (n = 1). All toxicities resolved after cis-RA was discontinued. Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases. Serum levels of 7.4 +\/- 3.0 mumol\/L (peak) and 4.0 +\/- 2.8 mumol\/L (trough) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy. The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol\/L. CONCLUSION: The MTD of cis-RA given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg\/m2\/d. Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose. The DLT included hypercalcemia, and may be predicted by serum cis-RA levels.

Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can \"dissociate\" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites.

Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped.

A 3 mg\/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg\/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect. However, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg\/kg) was without effect. In doses of 3-10 mg\/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist MK-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol. Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg\/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg\/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks. While (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg\/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg\/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition.

In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg\/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg\/kg) groups. In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg\/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated. In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg\/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days. However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used. RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg\/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats. In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test.

The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg\/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg\/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals.

Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine. Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine.

NIK-247, tacrine and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively). In addition, NIK-247 and tacrine, but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum. All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NIK-247 on AChE was reversible. All compounds at 0.1-1 mg\/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg\/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task. The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg\/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats. These findings suggest that NIK-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg\/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine-induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement.

Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples. Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN. The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 Da. In contrast, protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights. Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis (volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage. It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage."],"offsets":[[97,1555]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13430","type":"Disease","text":["injury to different regions of the kidney"],"offsets":[[54,95]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"13431","type":"Disease","text":["Acute experimental models of renal damage"],"offsets":[[97,138]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D058186"}]},{"id":"13432","type":"Chemical","text":["hexachloro-1:3-butadiene"],"offsets":[[244,268]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C001335"}]},{"id":"13433","type":"Chemical","text":["HCBD"],"offsets":[[270,274]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C001335"}]},{"id":"13434","type":"Chemical","text":["puromycin aminonucleoside"],"offsets":[[277,302]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011692"}]},{"id":"13435","type":"Chemical","text":["PAN"],"offsets":[[304,307]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011692"}]},{"id":"13436","type":"Chemical","text":["2-bromoethylamine"],"offsets":[[314,331]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004504"}]},{"id":"13437","type":"Chemical","text":["BEA"],"offsets":[[333,336]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004504"}]},{"id":"13438","type":"Disease","text":["nephrotoxicity"],"offsets":[[383,397]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"13439","type":"Disease","text":["protein excretion"],"offsets":[[495,512]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13440","type":"Chemical","text":["HCBD"],"offsets":[[574,578]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C001335"}]},{"id":"13441","type":"Chemical","text":["BEA"],"offsets":[[582,585]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004504"}]},{"id":"13442","type":"Disease","text":["glomerular damage"],"offsets":[[647,664]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]},{"id":"13443","type":"Chemical","text":["PAN"],"offsets":[[677,680]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011692"}]},{"id":"13444","type":"Disease","text":["protein excretion"],"offsets":[[739,756]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13445","type":"Disease","text":["protein excretion"],"offsets":[[837,854]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13446","type":"Disease","text":["excretion of proteins"],"offsets":[[919,940]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011507"}]},{"id":"13447","type":"Chemical","text":["HCBD"],"offsets":[[1013,1017]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C001335"}]},{"id":"13448","type":"Chemical","text":["BEA"],"offsets":[[1049,1052]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C004504"}]},{"id":"13449","type":"Chemical","text":["glucose"],"offsets":[[1206,1213]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005947"}]},{"id":"13450","type":"Disease","text":["renal damage"],"offsets":[[1542,1554]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007674"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"13451","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13434","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13452","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13435","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13453","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13443","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13454","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13434","arg2_id":"13439","normalized":[]},{"id":"13455","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13434","arg2_id":"13444","normalized":[]},{"id":"13456","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13434","arg2_id":"13445","normalized":[]},{"id":"13457","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13434","arg2_id":"13446","normalized":[]},{"id":"13458","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13435","arg2_id":"13439","normalized":[]},{"id":"13459","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13435","arg2_id":"13444","normalized":[]},{"id":"13460","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13435","arg2_id":"13445","normalized":[]},{"id":"13461","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13435","arg2_id":"13446","normalized":[]},{"id":"13462","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13443","arg2_id":"13439","normalized":[]},{"id":"13463","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13443","arg2_id":"13444","normalized":[]},{"id":"13464","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13443","arg2_id":"13445","normalized":[]},{"id":"13465","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13443","arg2_id":"13446","normalized":[]},{"id":"13466","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13436","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13467","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13437","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13468","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13441","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13469","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13448","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13470","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13432","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13471","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13433","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13472","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13440","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]},{"id":"13473","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13447","arg2_id":"13431","normalized":[]}]}

The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg\/m2\/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg\/m2\/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg\/m2\/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg\/m2\/d delivers a total dose of 7 g\/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained."],"offsets":[[81,1626]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13499","type":"Chemical","text":["Ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[0,10]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"13500","type":"Chemical","text":["mesna"],"offsets":[[39,44]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]},{"id":"13501","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[120,130]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"13502","type":"Chemical","text":["Mesna"],"offsets":[[197,202]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]},{"id":"13503","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[282,292]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"13504","type":"Chemical","text":["Mesna"],"offsets":[[378,383]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]},{"id":"13505","type":"Disease","text":["hematuria"],"offsets":[[507,516]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006417"}]},{"id":"13506","type":"Disease","text":["hematuria"],"offsets":[[586,595]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006417"}]},{"id":"13507","type":"Disease","text":["toxicity"],"offsets":[[652,660]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064420"}]},{"id":"13508","type":"Disease","text":["confusion"],"offsets":[[662,671]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003221"}]},{"id":"13509","type":"Disease","text":["nausea"],"offsets":[[677,683]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009325"}]},{"id":"13510","type":"Disease","text":["leukopenia"],"offsets":[[701,711]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007970"}]},{"id":"13511","type":"Disease","text":["hematuria"],"offsets":[[1046,1055]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006417"}]},{"id":"13512","type":"Chemical","text":["Mesna"],"offsets":[[1142,1147]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]},{"id":"13513","type":"Disease","text":["hematuria"],"offsets":[[1192,1201]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006417"}]},{"id":"13514","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[1240,1250]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"13515","type":"Chemical","text":["Mesna"],"offsets":[[1304,1309]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"13516","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13505","normalized":[]},{"id":"13517","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13506","normalized":[]},{"id":"13518","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13511","normalized":[]},{"id":"13519","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13513","normalized":[]},{"id":"13520","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13505","normalized":[]},{"id":"13521","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13506","normalized":[]},{"id":"13522","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13511","normalized":[]},{"id":"13523","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13513","normalized":[]},{"id":"13524","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13505","normalized":[]},{"id":"13525","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13506","normalized":[]},{"id":"13526","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13511","normalized":[]},{"id":"13527","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13513","normalized":[]},{"id":"13528","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13505","normalized":[]},{"id":"13529","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13506","normalized":[]},{"id":"13530","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13511","normalized":[]},{"id":"13531","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13513","normalized":[]},{"id":"13532","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13510","normalized":[]},{"id":"13533","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13510","normalized":[]},{"id":"13534","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13510","normalized":[]},{"id":"13535","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13510","normalized":[]},{"id":"13536","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13508","normalized":[]},{"id":"13537","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13508","normalized":[]},{"id":"13538","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13508","normalized":[]},{"id":"13539","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13508","normalized":[]},{"id":"13540","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13499","arg2_id":"13509","normalized":[]},{"id":"13541","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13501","arg2_id":"13509","normalized":[]},{"id":"13542","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13503","arg2_id":"13509","normalized":[]},{"id":"13543","type":"CID","arg1_id":"13514","arg2_id":"13509","normalized":[]}]}

CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng\/mL. An initial exercise stress test was normal. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. It showed normal coronary vessels.

We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (Ishihara) and visual field. The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm. TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale. OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function. CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up.

In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of NSAID-induced urticaria\/angioedema. Furthermore, we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide. A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID-induced urticaria\/angioedema. A total of 75\/829 (9.4%) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol. Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 (8.6%) showed a positive test, while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol, 13 (9.6%) did not tolerate this drug. Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8% of subjects with an history of NSAID-induced urticaria\/angioedema or angioedema alone (with or without chronic urticaria) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs. Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria\/angioedema caused by NSAIDs.

There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF. RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+\/-4 s (mean+\/-S.E.) to 95+\/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg\/kg and 228+\/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg\/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil. In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+\/-5 to 114+\/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+\/-1 to 10+\/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+\/-4 to 84+\/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem."],"offsets":[[95,2233]]}],"entities":[{"id":"13935","type":"Chemical","text":["verapamil"],"offsets":[[11,20]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014700"}]},{"id":"13936","type":"Disease","text":["atrial

There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event.

The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals. Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT). While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide (NAA), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD. In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP, and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the liver damage was inhibited by 50% by ethanol. A further 64% reduction of hepatitis was observed, when NAA was given to ethanol\/AAP-mice. Our results provide evidence that the AAP-induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate NAD.

Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg\/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+\/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+\/-0.9. First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice.

Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U\/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+\/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+\/-11.2 microL, P=0.015).

Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes. This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol-related fetal growth impairment. METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study. The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies. Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) alcohol consumers. Fetal measures from the heavy-exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics. Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse. RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies. When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-alcohol-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns. Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers.

CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty women (aged 30-77 years) diagnosed as having OAB at the Gynecology Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study. Tolterodine 2 mg, twice daily was given. After 8 weeks treatment, changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined. Short form 36 (SF36) questionaires (Thai version) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, all micturition per day decreased from 16. 7 +\/- 5. 3 to 6. 7 +\/- 2.4 times per day. The number of nocturia episodes decreased from 5.4 +\/- 4.2 to 1.1 +\/- 1.0 times per night. The most common side effect was dry month in 5 cases (16.7%) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree. Only one case (3.3%) withdrew from the present study due to a severe dry mouth.

However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries. Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use. METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites. Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter. Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls. There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests). There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests). Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg\/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg\/d by day 54. Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients. RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months. Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg\/day dose level. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma.

There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis. No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia. The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U\/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg\/dL. There was slow improvement over 4 months.

The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg\/kg\/min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache-free days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20 and 60 min after start of infusion. Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on GTN vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the GTN day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36). Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the GTN and placebo days (P < 0.05).

Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine. We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (variant angina). Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients. DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg\/kg\/min every 5 minutes. Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation. All 7 patients (13.7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy. These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina. When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of

This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E-fortified food for 12 weeks. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group. The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations. In conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension."],"offsets":[[77,1891]]}],"entities":[{"id":"15091","type":"Chemical","text":["Nitric

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Academic primary care practices. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up echocardiography. The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation). RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving fenfluramine-phentermine developed valvular heart disease. One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation. The second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency.

However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration (10 mg\/kg and 15 mg\/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats. Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity. Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system."],"offsets":[[71,1654]]}],"entities":[{"id":"15237","type":"Chemical","text":["Carboplatin"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016190"}]},{"id":"15238","type":"Chemical","text":["carboplatin"],"offsets":[[104,115]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016190"}]},{"id":"15239","type":"Chemical","text":["CBDCA"],"offsets":[[130,135]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016190"}]},{"id":"15240","type":"Chemical","text":["cisplatin"],"offsets":[[142,151]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002945"}]},{"id":"15241","type":"Chemical","text":["CDDP"],"offsets":[[153,157]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002945"}]},{"id":"15242","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxic"],"offsets":[[191,201]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"15243","type":"Chemical","text":["CBDCA"],"offsets":[[231,236]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D016190"}]},{"id":"15244","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxic"],"offsets":[[295,305]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"15245","type":"Disease","text":["peripheral

We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis. Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted."],"offsets":[[185,2126]]}],"entities":[{"id":"15288","type":"Disease","text":["endometrial

DESIGN: Fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia. The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls. Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days. SETTING: Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Zeynep Kamil Women and Children's Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum prolactin levels, uterine histopathology. RESULTS: The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups. Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis, all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma.

Patients were monitored for 23 +\/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +\/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion. Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +\/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +\/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +\/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +\/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course.

METHOD: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross-sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted. The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record. Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years. Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia. As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity. After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03). Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05). These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients. Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents. Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues."],"offsets":[[135,2202]]}],"entities":[{"id":"15985","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[46,57]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15986","type":"Chemical","text":["serotonin"],"offsets":[[72,81]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012701"}]},{"id":"15987","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[208,219]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15988","type":"Disease","text":["hyperprolactinemia"],"offsets":[[228,246]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006966"}]},{"id":"15989","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[420,431]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15990","type":"Disease","text":["Hyperprolactinemia"],"offsets":[[957,975]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006966"}]},{"id":"15991","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[1028,1039]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15992","type":"Chemical","text":["testosterone"],"offsets":[[1071,1083]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013739"}]},{"id":"15993","type":"Disease","text":["hyperprolactinemia"],"offsets":[[1153,1171]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006966"}]},{"id":"15994","type":"Chemical","text":["serotonin"],"offsets":[[1514,1523]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012701"}]},{"id":"15995","type":"Disease","text":["fractures"],"offsets":[[1782,1791]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D050723"}]},{"id":"15996","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[1810,1821]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15997","type":"Disease","text":["hyperprolactinemia"],"offsets":[[1881,1899]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006966"}]},{"id":"15998","type":"Chemical","text":["risperidone"],"offsets":[[1946,1957]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018967"}]},{"id":"15999","type":"Disease","text":["hyperprolactinemia"],"offsets":[[1966,1984]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006966"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"16000","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15985","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16001","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15985","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16002","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15985","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16003","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15985","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16004","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15985","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]},{"id":"16005","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15987","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16006","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15987","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16007","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15987","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16008","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15987","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16009","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15987","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]},{"id":"16010","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15989","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16011","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15989","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16012","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15989","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16013","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15989","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16014","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15989","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]},{"id":"16015","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15991","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16016","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15991","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16017","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15991","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16018","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15991","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16019","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15991","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]},{"id":"16020","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15996","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16021","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15996","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16022","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15996","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16023","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15996","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16024","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15996","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]},{"id":"16025","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15998","arg2_id":"15988","normalized":[]},{"id":"16026","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15998","arg2_id":"15990","normalized":[]},{"id":"16027","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15998","arg2_id":"15993","normalized":[]},{"id":"16028","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15998","arg2_id":"15997","normalized":[]},{"id":"16029","type":"CID","arg1_id":"15998","arg2_id":"15999","normalized":[]}]}

However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated. The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +\/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine. This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion. In contrast, mPGES-1 -\/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +\/+ mice. This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -\/- mice. qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +\/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment. In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -\/- mice.

Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent hypotension in pigs. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg\/kg, corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3%.

DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo. This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax\/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis. Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue. In DOX B1R(-\/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax\/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.

We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients. METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years. Patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument. The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance. Eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant. All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment. Seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis. Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent. Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six. Drug-related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients. The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. CONCLUSION: Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important."],"offsets":[[139,1836]]}],"entities":[{"id":"16200","type":"Disease","text":["Hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[0,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16201","type":"Chemical","text":["sulfasalazine"],"offsets":[[31,44]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012460"}]},{"id":"16202","type":"Disease","text":["arthritis"],"offsets":[[61,70]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001168"}]},{"id":"16203","type":"Disease","text":["liver failure"],"offsets":[[473,486]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017093"}]},{"id":"16204","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[649,663]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16205","type":"Chemical","text":["sulfasalazine"],"offsets":[[667,680]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012460"}]},{"id":"16206","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[893,907]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16207","type":"Chemical","text":["sulfasalazine"],"offsets":[[913,926]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012460"}]},{"id":"16208","type":"Disease","text":["hepatic failure"],"offsets":[[1102,1117]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D017093"}]},{"id":"16209","type":"Disease","text":["skin rash"],"offsets":[[1232,1241]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005076"}]},{"id":"16210","type":"Disease","text":["eosinophilia"],"offsets":[[1249,1261]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004802"}]},{"id":"16211","type":"Disease","text":["interstitial nephritis"],"offsets":[[1270,1292]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009395"}]},{"id":"16212","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[1464,1478]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16213","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[1565,1579]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16214","type":"Chemical","text":["sulfasalazine"],"offsets":[[1585,1598]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012460"}]},{"id":"16215","type":"Disease","text":["hepatotoxicity"],"offsets":[[1662,1676]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D056486"}]},{"id":"16216","type":"Chemical","text":["sulfasalazine"],"offsets":[[1693,1706]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012460"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"16217","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16200","normalized":[]},{"id":"16218","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16204","normalized":[]},{"id":"16219","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16206","normalized":[]},{"id":"16220","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16212","normalized":[]},{"id":"16221","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16213","normalized":[]},{"id":"16222","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16201","arg2_id":"16215","normalized":[]},{"id":"16223","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16200","normalized":[]},{"id":"16224","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16204","normalized":[]},{"id":"16225","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16206","normalized":[]},{"id":"16226","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16212","normalized":[]},{"id":"16227","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16213","normalized":[]},{"id":"16228","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16205","arg2_id":"16215","normalized":[]},{"id":"16229","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16200","normalized":[]},{"id":"16230","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16204","normalized":[]},{"id":"16231","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16206","normalized":[]},{"id":"16232","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16212","normalized":[]},{"id":"16233","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16213","normalized":[]},{"id":"16234","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16207","arg2_id":"16215","normalized":[]},{"id":"16235","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16200","normalized":[]},{"id":"16236","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16204","normalized":[]},{"id":"16237","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16206","normalized":[]},{"id":"16238","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16212","normalized":[]},{"id":"16239","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16213","normalized":[]},{"id":"16240","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16214","arg2_id":"16215","normalized":[]},{"id":"16241","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16200","normalized":[]},{"id":"16242","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16204","normalized":[]},{"id":"16243","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16206","normalized":[]},{"id":"16244","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16212","normalized":[]},{"id":"16245","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16213","normalized":[]},{"id":"16246","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16216","arg2_id":"16215","normalized":[]}]}

Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention\/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed.

These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01). When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with

METHODS: From the Danish National Register of Patients (NRP), 1996 to 1998, the records of 1.1 million Danish women, ages 15 to 44 years, were searched for evidence of VTE. COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires. Sales statistics of COCs and CPA\/EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics. RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs. Of these women, 67 were on levonorgestrel-containing COCs. Eleven were on CPA\/EE. The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel-containing COCs, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA\/EE.

A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg\/kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days. As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain. Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1\/1A2, 2B1\/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes. In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1\/2B2, 1A1\/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively. Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), an inducer of P4501A1\/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1\/2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions. Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity."],"offsets":[[123,1974]]}],"entities":[{"id":"16603","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[10,17]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16604","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[92,99]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16605","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[108,121]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"16606","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[146,153]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16607","type":"Chemical","text":["N-nitrosodimethylamine"],"offsets":[[367,389]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004128"}]},{"id":"16608","type":"Chemical","text":["NDMA"],"offsets":[[403,407]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004128"}]},{"id":"16609","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[578,585]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16610","type":"Chemical","text":["NDMA"],"offsets":[[1170,1174]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004128"}]},{"id":"16611","type":"Chemical","text":["3-methylcholanthrene"],"offsets":[[1338,1358]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008748"}]},{"id":"16612","type":"Chemical","text":["MC"],"offsets":[[1360,1362]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008748"}]},{"id":"16613","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[1451,1458]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16614","type":"Disease","text":["convulsions"],"offsets":[[1467,1478]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"16615","type":"Chemical","text":["phenobarbital"],"offsets":[[1498,1511]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010634"}]},{"id":"16616","type":"Chemical","text":["ethanol"],"offsets":[[1548,1555]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000431"}]},{"id":"16617","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[1642,1649]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16618","type":"Disease","text":["convulsions"],"offsets":[[1658,1669]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D012640"}]},{"id":"16619","type":"Chemical","text":["lindane"],"offsets":[[1719,1726]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001556"}]},{"id":"16620","type":"Chemical","text":["cobalt

Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7. RESULTS: The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).

To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache."],"offsets":[[62,1340]]}],"entities":[{"id":"16766","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[21,25]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16767","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[38,47]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"16768","type":"Disease","text":["migraine"],"offsets":[[141,149]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008881"}]},{"id":"16769","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[221,229]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"16770","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[252,260]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"16771","type":"Disease","text":["migraine"],"offsets":[[344,352]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008881"}]},{"id":"16772","type":"Disease","text":["migraine"],"offsets":[[397,405]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008881"}]},{"id":"16773","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[471,475]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16774","type":"Disease","text":["migraine"],"offsets":[[567,575]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008881"}]},{"id":"16775","type":"Chemical","text":["capsaicin"],"offsets":[[604,613]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D002211"}]},{"id":"16776","type":"Disease","text":["painful"],"offsets":[[687,694]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16777","type":"Disease","text":["migraine"],"offsets":[[980,988]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008881"}]},{"id":"16778","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1043,1047]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16779","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1070,1074]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16780","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1245,1249]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"16781","type":"Disease","text":["headache"],"offsets":[[1293,1301]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006261"}]},{"id":"16782","type":"Disease","text":["cluster headache"],"offsets":[[1323,1339]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003027"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"16783","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16766","normalized":[]},{"id":"16784","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16773","normalized":[]},{"id":"16785","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16776","normalized":[]},{"id":"16786","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16778","normalized":[]},{"id":"16787","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16779","normalized":[]},{"id":"16788","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16767","arg2_id":"16780","normalized":[]},{"id":"16789","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16766","normalized":[]},{"id":"16790","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16773","normalized":[]},{"id":"16791","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16776","normalized":[]},{"id":"16792","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16778","normalized":[]},{"id":"16793","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16779","normalized":[]},{"id":"16794","type":"CID","arg1_id":"16775","arg2_id":"16780","normalized":[]}]}

Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months. The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later.

Thus, caffeine (3.3 mg\/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and\/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130\/85 mm Hg.

Caffeine-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion. Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives.

Most cases of ifosfamide-induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes. METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide-induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium. All patients were receiving high-dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure. RESULTS: Hallucinations occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening. Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely. CONCLUSIONS: Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity. The incidence may be dose and infusion-time related. The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide-induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity. \"Eyes-closed\" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation. Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence. Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear. If agitation becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., haloperidol) may be effective."],"offsets":[[53,1332]]}],"entities":[{"id":"17028","type":"Disease","text":["Hallucinations"],"offsets":[[0,14]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17029","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[19,29]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17030","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[38,51]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"17031","type":"Disease","text":["Hallucinations"],"offsets":[[65,79]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17032","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[104,117]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"17033","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[166,176]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17034","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[192,202]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17035","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinations"],"offsets":[[211,225]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17036","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[329,339]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17037","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinations"],"offsets":[[348,362]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17038","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[439,449]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17039","type":"Disease","text":["Hallucinations"],"offsets":[[510,524]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17040","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinations"],"offsets":[[669,683]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17041","type":"Disease","text":["Hallucinations"],"offsets":[[720,734]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17042","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[777,790]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"17043","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[890,900]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"17044","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinations"],"offsets":[[909,923]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17045","type":"Disease","text":["neurotoxicity"],"offsets":[[964,977]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020258"}]},{"id":"17046","type":"Disease","text":["hallucinatory"],"offsets":[[993,1006]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006212"}]},{"id":"17047","type":"Disease","text":["agitation"],"offsets":[[1243,1252]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011595"}]},{"id":"17048","type":"Chemical","text":["haloperidol"],"offsets":[[1302,1313]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006220"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"17049","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17028","normalized":[]},{"id":"17050","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17031","normalized":[]},{"id":"17051","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17035","normalized":[]},{"id":"17052","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17037","normalized":[]},{"id":"17053","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17039","normalized":[]},{"id":"17054","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17040","normalized":[]},{"id":"17055","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17041","normalized":[]},{"id":"17056","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17044","normalized":[]},{"id":"17057","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17029","arg2_id":"17046","normalized":[]},{"id":"17058","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17028","normalized":[]},{"id":"17059","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17031","normalized":[]},{"id":"17060","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17035","normalized":[]},{"id":"17061","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17037","normalized":[]},{"id":"17062","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17039","normalized":[]},{"id":"17063","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17040","normalized":[]},{"id":"17064","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17041","normalized":[]},{"id":"17065","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17044","normalized":[]},{"id":"17066","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17033","arg2_id":"17046","normalized":[]},{"id":"17067","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17028","normalized":[]},{"id":"17068","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17031","normalized":[]},{"id":"17069","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17035","normalized":[]},{"id":"17070","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17037","normalized":[]},{"id":"17071","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17039","normalized":[]},{"id":"17072","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17040","normalized":[]},{"id":"17073","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17041","normalized":[]},{"id":"17074","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17044","normalized":[]},{"id":"17075","type":"CID","arg1_id":"17034","arg2_id":"17046","normalized":[]},{"id":"17

Model-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one-compartment model. When the parameters were examined individually, duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly (P less than .05) with nephrotoxicity. In contrast, a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy (P less than .001) as an important factor. Based on this model and on Bayes' theorem, the predictive accuracy of identifying \"nephrotoxic\" patients increased from 0.17 to 0.39. When examined individually, mean IF, MIC, total dose, mean daily dose, and ln (mean Cmax\/MIC) correlated significantly (P less than .05) with cure.

The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol\/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-\/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug.

The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1\/2 tab of venlafaxine. Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity. He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis. His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light. Vital signs were: blood pressure 120\/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127\/min, respiratory rate 28\/min, and temperature 97 F. After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws. He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity. His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved. The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units\/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis. His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward.

They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA\/benserazide 50\/12.5 mg\/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia.

RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity. CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma, mast cell tumour, brain tumour, histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma. Throughout treatment, 56.9% of dogs experienced neutropenia, 34.2% experienced anaemia and 14.2% experienced thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37.8% of dogs, the most common sign of which was vomiting (24.3%). Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively. The incidence of hepatic failure was 1.2%.

Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg\/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg\/kg, i.p.). The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.). Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid (32 mg\/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained. The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg\/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality.

Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with CB 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg\/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients. Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects. Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved."],"offsets":[[127,1848]]}],"entities":[{"id":"17957","type":"Chemical","text":["N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic

This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity. Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg\/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg\/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg\/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO. This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative

In the study presented here, we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS-induced HC. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of IFS. One, two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna. Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS. Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS-induced HC. However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC."],"offsets":[[95,1376]]}],"entities":[{"id":"18183","type":"Chemical","text":["dexamethasone"],"offsets":[[7,20]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003907"}]},{"id":"18184","type":"Chemical","text":["mesna"],"offsets":[[26,31]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015080"}]},{"id":"18185","type":"Chemical","text":["ifosfamide"],"offsets":[[54,64]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007069"}]},{"id":"18186","type":"Disease","text":["hemorrhagic

This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. Reserpine (1 mg\/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg\/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice. Reserpine (1 mg\/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg\/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg\/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine. Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg\/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg\/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine. These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed

METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine-morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion (Nitrolingual 1 microg\/kg\/min for 120 min). RESULTS: Prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +\/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +\/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +\/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +\/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1\/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +\/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +\/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +\/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +\/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +\/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +\/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +\/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +\/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +\/- 1.92; and T1\/2 over the LP: 28.21 +\/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +\/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +\/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans. Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine, it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia."],"offsets":[[108,1841]]}],"entities":[{"id":"18600","type":"Chemical","text":["glyceryl

Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid-treated groups (-50 and -79% in M and T, respectively). This was associated with a similar loss in body weight. In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied. Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment. Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +\/- 174 g\/cm(2)) than in the M group (837 +\/- 171 g\/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +\/- 145 g\/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with M, whereas tetanic tensions were similar. Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05). ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone."],"offsets":[[87,2130]]}],"entities":[{"id":"18906","type":"Chemical","text":["steroid"],"offsets":[[17,24]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013256"}]},{"id":"18907","type":"Disease","text":["myopathy"],"offsets":[[133,141]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009135"}]},{"id":"18908","type":"Chemical","text":["corticosteroids"],"offsets":[[194,209]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000305"}]},{"id":"18909","type":"Disease","text":["myopathy"],"offsets":[[233,241]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009135"}]},{"id":"18910","type":"Chemical","text":["methylprednisolone"],"offsets":[[353,371]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008775"}]},{"id":"18911","type":"Chemical","text":["M"],"offsets":[[373,374]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D008775"}]},{"id":"18912","type":"Chemical","text":["triamcinolone"],"offsets":[[380,393]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014221"}]},{"id":"18913","type":"Chemical","text":["T"],"offsets":[[395,396]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014221"}]},{"id":"18914","type":"Disease","text":["reduction

Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities. There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation. Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance.

Because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g\/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy. After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day. After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A). However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g\/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group B). We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8\/27) in group A and 10% (1\/10) in group B, respectively. A 34.4% (12\/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1\/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance. With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g\/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g\/dl ( P = 0.036).

However, the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined. We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel (ENaC) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention. An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN; 180 mg\/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM. Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)\/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na-K-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome. The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC-1, TSC, and Na-K-ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium

We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR). METHODS: The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum\/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system. Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR-induced nephropathy groups. These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-NO synthase. On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR-nephropathy group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR-nephropathy group. Apoptosis was not detected in controls. However, in the ADR-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes\/macrophages. Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels.

Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia

Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg\/day. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals. Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly nausea (64%), fatigue (55%) and headache (49%). These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment. A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy. This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase. The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg\/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg\/day.

This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and\/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration.

Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg\/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures.

Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation. The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +\/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam (3.4 +\/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +\/- 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (NS).

Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified. DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate. METHODS: Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean (+\/-SD) age of 63 (+\/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening). On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period. RESULTS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (P < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats\/min). Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with timolol solution. During the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo. This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period. These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma.

Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions.

We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent the pain without producing complications. METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or remifentanil to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI. After the target Ce was achieved, the infusion of propofol was started. Remifentanil-related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion, and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four-point scale during the propofol infusion. RESULTS: The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12\/32 and 6\/31 vs 26\/31 and 25\/32, respectively, P<0.001). Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001). However, both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6. No significant complications were observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil, a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a target Ce of 4 ng ml(-1)."],"offsets":[[85,1692]]}],"entities":[{"id":"20513","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[13,17]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20514","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[58,66]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20515","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[71,83]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20516","type":"Disease","text":["Pain"],"offsets":[[97,101]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20517","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[118,126]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20518","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[163,171]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20519","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[181,185]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20520","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[217,229]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20521","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[250,258]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20522","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[486,498]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20523","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[514,518]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20524","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[674,686]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20525","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[833,841]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20526","type":"Chemical","text":["Remifentanil"],"offsets":[[855,867]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20527","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[915,927]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20528","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[942,946]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20529","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[957,965]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20530","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[1016,1024]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20531","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1061,1065]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20532","type":"Disease","text":["Pain"],"offsets":[[1204,1208]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20533","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1330,1334]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20534","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[1498,1506]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20535","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[1511,1523]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]},{"id":"20536","type":"Chemical","text":["propofol"],"offsets":[[1552,1560]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D015742"}]},{"id":"20537","type":"Disease","text":["pain"],"offsets":[[1570,1574]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010146"}]},{"id":"20538","type":"Chemical","text":["remifentanil"],"offsets":[[1649,1661]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"C071741"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"20539","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20513","normalized":[]},{"id":"20540","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20516","normalized":[]},{"id":"20541","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20519","normalized":[]},{"id":"20542","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20523","normalized":[]},{"id":"20543","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20528","normalized":[]},{"id":"20544","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20531","normalized":[]},{"id":"20545","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20532","normalized":[]},{"id":"20546","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20533","normalized":[]},{"id":"20547","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20514","arg2_id":"20537","normalized":[]},{"id":"20548","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20513","normalized":[]},{"id":"20549","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20516","normalized":[]},{"id":"20550","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20519","normalized":[]},{"id":"20551","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20523","normalized":[]},{"id":"20552","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20528","normalized":[]},{"id":"20553","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20531","normalized":[]},{"id":"20554","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20532","normalized":[]},{"id":"20555","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20533","normalized":[]},{"id":"20556","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20517","arg2_id":"20537","normalized":[]},{"id":"20557","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20518","arg2_id":"20513","normalized":[]},{"id":"20558","type":"CID","arg1_id":"20518","arg2_id":"20516","normalized":[]},{"id":"205

Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn. The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate. METHODS: Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine (10 mg\/kg) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section. As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals, and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 +\/- 1% in 1-day-old control animals and significantly lower (P < 0.01) in fluoxetine-exposed pups (79 +\/- 2%). In vitro, fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal, but not adult, animals (P < 0.01) and reduced serotonin-induced contraction at both ages (P < 0.01). After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal, but not adult, cells (P < 0.01).

Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users. As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis. Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included. The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs. All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope. The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms\/mg (p = 0.002). No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found. Among the subjects treated with methadone, 28% men and 32% women had prolonged QTc interval. None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval >0.440 s((1\/2)). A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope.

Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone.

Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases. Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity.

Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg\/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU\/kg) administered s.c. three times\/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application. Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg\/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. In the anemia group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days).

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol. Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats\/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon.

With institutional approval, 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg\/kg prednisolone (P10 group), 100 mg\/kg prednisolone (P100 group), or an equal volume of saline (S group) for 7 days. A fourth group of rats was pair fed (food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days (FR group). On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of d-tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs. Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group. Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups. The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group. The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine (microg\/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +\/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +\/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +\/- 9.6) groups. AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group. The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR. The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression. Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression. IMPLICATIONS: The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear. We suggest that the observed effects are dose-dependent and derive primarily from muscle atrophy and derive less from changes in acetylcholine receptor expression."],"offsets":[[117,2348]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21214","type":"Chemical","text":["Prednisolone"],"offsets":[[0,12]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011239"}]},{"id":"21215","type":"Disease","text":["muscle dysfunction"],"offsets":[[21,39]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018908"}]},{"id":"21216","type":"Disease","text":["atrophy"],"offsets":[[58,65]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001284"}]},{"id":"21217","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylcholine"],"offsets":[[82,95]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]},{"id":"21218","type":"Chemical","text":["prednisolone"],"offsets":[[324,336]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011239"}]},{"id":"21219","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylcholine"],"offsets":[[427,440]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]},{"id":"21220","type":"Chemical","text":["prednisolone"],"offsets":[[593,605]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011239"}]},{"id":"21221","type":"Chemical","text":["prednisolone"],"offsets":[[629,641]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011239"}]},{"id":"21222","type":"Disease","text":["tetanic"],"offsets":[[852,859]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013746"}]},{"id":"21223","type":"Chemical","text":["d-tubocurarine"],"offsets":[[920,934]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014403"}]},{"id":"21224","type":"Disease","text":["tetanic"],"offsets":[[1246,1253]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013746"}]},{"id":"21225","type":"Chemical","text":["d-tubocurarine"],"offsets":[[1443,1457]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014403"}]},{"id":"21226","type":"Chemical","text":["d-tubocurarine"],"offsets":[[1796,1810]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D014403"}]},{"id":"21227","type":"Disease","text":["neuromuscular dysfunction"],"offsets":[[1895,1920]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009468"}]},{"id":"21228","type":"Chemical","text":["prednisolone"],"offsets":[[1927,1939]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011239"}]},{"id":"21229","type":"Disease","text":["muscle atrophy"],"offsets":[[1986,2000]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009133"}]},{"id":"21230","type":"Disease","text":["muscle atrophy"],"offsets":[[2267,2281]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009133"}]},{"id":"21231","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylcholine"],"offsets":[[2314,2327]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D000109"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"21232","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21214","arg2_id":"21215","normalized":[]},{"id":"21233","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21218","arg2_id":"21215","normalized":[]},{"id":"21234","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21220","arg2_id":"21215","normalized":[]},{"id":"21235","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21221","arg2_id":"21215","normalized":[]},{"id":"21236","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21228","arg2_id":"21215","normalized":[]},{"id":"21237","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21214","arg2_id":"21229","normalized":[]},{"id":"21238","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21214","arg2_id":"21230","normalized":[]},{"id":"21239","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21218","arg2_id":"21229","normalized":[]},{"id":"21240","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21218","arg2_id":"21230","normalized":[]},{"id":"21241","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21220","arg2_id":"21229","normalized":[]},{"id":"21242","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21220","arg2_id":"21230","normalized":[]},{"id":"21243","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21221","arg2_id":"21229","normalized":[]},{"id":"21244","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21221","arg2_id":"21230","normalized":[]},{"id":"21245","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21228","arg2_id":"21229","normalized":[]},{"id":"21246","type":"CID","arg1_id":"21228","arg2_id":"21230","normalized":[]}]}

Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI. The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0.

Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN.

Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin.

The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P). DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied.

Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg\/kg body wt\/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV.

The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes. In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically. In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically. EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity. In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges.

Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2(-\/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage. This is evident by Nrf2(-\/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2(+\/+) mice. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy."],"offsets":[[76,1977]]}],"entities":[{"id":"21944","type":"Chemical","text":["streptozotocin"],"offsets":[[31,45]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013311"}]},{"id":"21945","type":"Disease","text":["diabetic

These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg\/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent.

The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. In the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 Hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 dB (-0.17 to 2.14 dB; P = 0.09) was detected. Dose intensity did not add information to models. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). Follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 dB (-0.81 to 2.96 dB; P = 0.26) between treatment arms. There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group. The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; P = 0.12).

METHODS: This study comprised 24 cognitively intact, health elderly adults (12 APOE epsilon4 carriers) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic. This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, crossover experimental design. All participants received 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks. Bond and Lader's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline, 1, 2.5, and 5 hours postdrug administration. RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only.

Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg\/kg, every other day); controls received saline. At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with testosterone (T, 5 mg\/kg, 5 days\/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, partner preference, and aggression. Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive

These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop."],"offsets":[[97,1158]]}],"entities":[{"id":"22427","type":"Disease","text":["parkinsonian"],"offsets":[[33,45]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020734"}]},{"id":"22428","type":"Chemical","text":["L-dopa"],"offsets":[[60,66]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"22429","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesia"],"offsets":[[85,95]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22430","type":"Disease","text":["parkinsonian"],"offsets":[[292,304]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020734"}]},{"id":"22431","type":"Chemical","text":["L-dopa"],"offsets":[[317,323]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"22432","type":"Chemical","text":["L-dopa"],"offsets":[[358,364]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"22433","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesia"],"offsets":[[373,383]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22434","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesia"],"offsets":[[431,441]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22435","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinetic"],"offsets":[[582,592]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22436","type":"Disease","text":["parkinsonian"],"offsets":[[593,605]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020734"}]},{"id":"22437","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinetic"],"offsets":[[718,728]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22438","type":"Disease","text":["parkinsonian"],"offsets":[[729,741]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D020734"}]},{"id":"22439","type":"Disease","text":["hyperkinetic"],"offsets":[[928,940]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006948"}]},{"id":"22440","type":"Disease","text":["abnormal involuntary movement"],"offsets":[[941,970]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"22441","type":"Chemical","text":["L-dopa"],"offsets":[[977,983]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"22442","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesia"],"offsets":[[1002,1012]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"22443","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22429","normalized":[]},{"id":"22444","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22433","normalized":[]},{"id":"22445","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22434","normalized":[]},{"id":"22446","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22435","normalized":[]},{"id":"22447","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22437","normalized":[]},{"id":"22448","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22440","normalized":[]},{"id":"22449","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22428","arg2_id":"22442","normalized":[]},{"id":"22450","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22429","normalized":[]},{"id":"22451","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22433","normalized":[]},{"id":"22452","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22434","normalized":[]},{"id":"22453","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22435","normalized":[]},{"id":"22454","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22437","normalized":[]},{"id":"22455","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22440","normalized":[]},{"id":"22456","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22431","arg2_id":"22442","normalized":[]},{"id":"22457","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22429","normalized":[]},{"id":"22458","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22433","normalized":[]},{"id":"22459","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22434","normalized":[]},{"id":"22460","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22435","normalized":[]},{"id":"22461","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22437","normalized":[]},{"id":"22462","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22440","normalized":[]},{"id":"22463","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22432","arg2_id":"22442","normalized":[]},{"id":"22464","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22429","normalized":[]},{"id":"22465","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22433","normalized":[]},{"id":"22466","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22434","normalized":[]},{"id":"22467","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22435","normalized":[]},{"id":"22468","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22437","normalized":[]},{"id":"22469","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22440","normalized":[]},{"id":"22470","type":"CID","arg1_id":"22441","arg2_id":"22442","normalized":[]}]}

The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes. METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M dexamethasone for 12 days. Intraocular pressure was monitored daily. After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +\/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure. The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive dexamethasone, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period. The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal. In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. The dexamethasone-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle dexamethasone-induced morphologic changes were evident. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes. Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma. This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle

To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg\/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be

METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension. Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position. Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)\/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP\/ DBP <130\/<80 mm Hg) at end of study. Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn. At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP (T+A [-27.4%]; A [-16.6%]) and DBP (T+A [-20.1%]; A [-13.3%]) (all, P < 0.05). Response rates were 87.3% (89\/102) in the T+A group and 69.3% (70\/101) in the A group (P < 0.05). The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (T+A, 16.0% [17\/106]; A, 15.4% [16\/104]). Peripheral edema was reported in 8.5% patients (9\/106) in the T+A group compared with 13.5% (14\/104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3.8% patients (4\/106) in the T+A group and 1.0% (1\/104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance. The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups.

Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +\/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy."],"offsets":[[132,2105]]}],"entities":[{"id":"23079","type":"Chemical","text":["Dexrazoxane"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D064730"}]},{"id":"23080","type":"Disease","text":["myelosuppression"],"offsets":[[29,45]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001855"}]},{"id":"23081","type":"Chemical","text":["etoposide"],"offsets":[[84,93]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005047"}]},{"id":"23082","type":"Chemical","text":["daunorubicin"],"offsets":[[98,110]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003630"}]},{"id":"23083","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[119,130]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"23084","type":"Chemical","text":["anthracyclines"],"offsets":[[145,159]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018943"}]},{"id":"23085","type":"Chemical","text":["daunorubicin"],"offsets":[[160,172]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003630"}]},{"id":"23086","type":"Chemical","text":["doxorubicin"],"offsets":[[177,188]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004317"}]},{"id":"23087","type":"Chemical","text":["epipodophyllotoxin"],"offsets":[[197,215]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D011034"}]},{"id":"23088","type":"Chemical","text":["etoposide"],"offsets":[[216,225]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D005047"}]},{"id":"23089","type":"Disease","text":["myelosuppression"],"offsets":[[318,334]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001855"}]},{"id":"23090","type":"Disease","text":["cardiac

These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg\/kg. Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped.

Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg\/m(2) of Myocet (M) or conventional doxorubicin (A), in combination with 600 mg\/m(2) of cyclophosphamide (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left-ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure (CHF). Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates (World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival. RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% (including five cases of CHF) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity (P =.0002). Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2,220 mg\/m(2) for MC versus 480 mg\/m(2) for AC (P =.0001, hazard ratio, 5.04). MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia. Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5.1% versus 5.5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4.6 versus 4.4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months. CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination

Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN 52021 (10 mg\/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg\/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg\/kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg\/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When BN 52021 (20 mg\/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg\/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg\/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021. Since the administration of BN 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021, a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity.

Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration, the ability of benzylacyclouridine (BAU) to effect, in vivo, AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed. This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd-related toxicity. In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg\/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU (300 mg\/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis. When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, BAU reduced AZT-induced marrow toxicity. In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol\/L, BAU possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells. The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are

Cyclophosphamide (CP), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein, was used to induce cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CP was administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg.\/kg. i.p. to male rats, and their behavior observed and scored. The effects of morphine (0.5 to 4 mg.\/kg. i.v.) on CP-induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone (1 mg.\/kg. s.c.). In addition, 90 minutes after CP injection, that is, at the time of administration of morphine, the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination. Finally, to show that the bladder is essential for the CP-induced behavioral modifications, female rats also received CP at doses of 200 mg.\/kg. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route, and acrolein at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg.\/kg. i.v. RESULTS: CP dose-relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats: breathing rate decrease, closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures. Morphine dose-dependently reversed these behavioral disorders. A dose of 0.5 mg.\/kg. produced a reduction of almost 50% of the behavioral score induced by CP 200 mg.\/kg. This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone. At the time of administration of morphine, histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer edema, were observed. In female rats, CP 200 mg.\/kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats. Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, CP did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas acrolein at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg.\/kg. i.p., with the same maximal levels. Conversely, acrolein 5 mg.\/kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of CP-induced cystitis may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain, allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them."],"offsets":[[120,2371]]}],"entities":[{"id":"23722","type":"Chemical","text":["Cyclophosphamide"],"offsets":[[0,16]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003520"}]},{"id":"23723","type":"Disease","text":["cystitis"],"offsets":[[25,33]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D003556"}]},{"id":"23724","type":"Disease","text":["visceral

Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia\/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome.

Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry).

A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac-dextran conjugates (ED) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. An activated moiety, i.e. N-acylimidazole derivative of etodolac (EAI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000). IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates. Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis. The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark-Howink-Sakurada equation. In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers (pH 1.2, 7.4, 9) and in 80% (v\/v) human plasma (pH 7.4). At pH 9, a higher rate of etodolac release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics. In vivo investigations were performed in animals.

Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Three large urban hospitals (with active cardiovascular surgery programs). PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of heparin-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial (4 patients) or both. Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells\/L; mean nadir after heparin re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells\/L). Results of serologic tests for heparin-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, warfarin (11 patients). Three patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not heparin, should be initiated."],"offsets":[[48,2177]]}],"entities":[{"id":"24232","type":"Chemical","text":["heparin"],"offsets":[[14,21]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006493"}]},{"id":"24233","type":"Disease","text":["thrombocytopenia"],"offsets":[[30,46]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"24234","type":"Chemical","text":["Heparin"],"offsets":[[60,67]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006493"}]},{"id":"24235","type":"Disease","text":["thrombocytopenia"],"offsets":[[76,92]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D013921"}]},{"id":"24236","type":"Chemical","text":["heparin"],"offsets":[[121,128]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006493"}]},{"id":"24237","type":"Disease","text":["arterial

METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks. After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy. Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks. Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates. RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed. For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7). Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39). Both treatments were well tolerated. The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine). CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium

KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg\/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg\/kg i.p.). These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg\/kg p.o., respectively. Moreover, KF17837 (0.625 mg\/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 25 mg\/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (6.25 mg\/kg i.p.).

In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear. However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg\/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg\/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg\/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS.

We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye-blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day). The tic-like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day. However, her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction.

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4:15-24, 1971). There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg\/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg\/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg\/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg\/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally. RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low-incidence malformations. In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11. In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses."],"offsets":[[114,2561]]}],"entities":[{"id":"24938","type":"Chemical","text":["aspirin"],"offsets":[[42,49]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001241"}]},{"id":"24939","type":"Chemical","text":["acetylsalicylic

We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide. This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously.

While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use."],"offsets":[[63,1623]]}],"entities":[{"id":"25269","type":"Chemical","text":["Apomorphine"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25270","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[42,61]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"25271","type":"Chemical","text":["Apomorphine"],"offsets":[[63,74]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25272","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[138,157]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"25273","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[273,292]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"25274","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[327,338]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25275","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[493,504]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25276","type":"Chemical","text":["levodopa"],"offsets":[[590,598]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"25277","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[608,619]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25278","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[745,756]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25279","type":"Chemical","text":["dopamine"],"offsets":[[930,938]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004298"}]},{"id":"25280","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1055,1066]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25281","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1174,1185]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25282","type":"Chemical","text":["levodopa"],"offsets":[[1248,1256]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"25283","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[1265,1276]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"25284","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1316,1327]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25285","type":"Disease","text":["psychiatric"],"offsets":[[1407,1418]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001523"}]},{"id":"25286","type":"Chemical","text":["apomorphine"],"offsets":[[1505,1516]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D001058"}]},{"id":"25287","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[1542,1561]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"25288","type":"CID","arg1_id":"25276","arg2_id":"25283","normalized":[]},{"id":"25289","type":"CID","arg1_id":"25282","arg2_id":"25283","normalized":[]}]}

We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. Urine samples were collected. NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB. In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB. CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients.

The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia. The incidence and severity of succinylcholine-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each). Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia (not significant). In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL-6 was found. In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine-associated myalgia. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation. Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine."],"offsets":[[85,1796]]}],"entities":[{"id":"25718","type":"Disease","text":["Postoperative

Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air\/oxygen only.

The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and\/or GABA(A)R function. The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs). The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia.

The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection.

These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Affective Disorders Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal. PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow-up. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline. All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of lithium therapy). Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%). Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After lithium treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging.

After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis. OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus-induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus-treated patient with psoriasis (21%). Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever, anemia, and capillary leak syndrome. These symptoms may be the result of drug-induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators.

DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States. PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study. RESULTS: Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg\/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%). Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol\/L (160 mg\/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol\/L (130 mg\/dL). Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose. Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg). Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin.

In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms\/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms\/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms\/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms\/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg\/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms\/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg\/kg], or; 6) saline.

ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO. Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.

In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment.

The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium.

Given VIP's role as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-\/-) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis. A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-\/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg\/kg; i.p.; 48 h). Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-\/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-\/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h) versus VIP(-\/-) with CYP treatment (48 h). The genes presented represent (1) greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being made. Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays including IL-1beta and CXCL1. CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP(-\/-) mice, but expression in VIP(-\/-) mice with CYP treatment was significantly (p < or = 0.001) greater (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase).

Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the \"on\" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the \"off\" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the \"freezing\" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy."],"offsets":[[53,1362]]}],"entities":[{"id":"26853","type":"Disease","text":["Parkinson's disease"],"offsets":[[107,126]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"26854","type":"Disease","text":["PD"],"offsets":[[128,130]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"26855","type":"Disease","text":["PD"],"offsets":[[271,273]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"26856","type":"Disease","text":["PD"],"offsets":[[666,668]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D010300"}]},{"id":"26857","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[678,689]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"26858","type":"Disease","text":["rigidity"],"offsets":[[730,738]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009127"}]},{"id":"26859","type":"Disease","text":["bradykinesia"],"offsets":[[740,752]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018476"}]},{"id":"26860","type":"Disease","text":["bradykinesia"],"offsets":[[809,821]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D018476"}]},{"id":"26861","type":"Disease","text":["rigidity"],"offsets":[[826,834]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D009127"}]},{"id":"26862","type":"Chemical","text":["levodopa"],"offsets":[[901,909]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D007980"}]},{"id":"26863","type":"Disease","text":["dyskinesias"],"offsets":[[918,929]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]},{"id":"26864","type":"Disease","text":["hyper- or dyskinetic"],"offsets":[[980,1000]],"normalized":[{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D006948"},{"db_name":"MESH","db_id":"D004409"}]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"26865","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26862","arg2_id":"26857","normalized":[]},{"id":"26866","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26862","arg2_id":"26863","normalized":[]},{"id":"26867","type":"CID","arg1_id":"26862","arg2_id":"26864","normalized":[]}]}

Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX. PARP-1+\/+ and PARP-1-\/- mice received a single injection of DOX (25 mg\/kg i.p). Five days after DOX administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+\/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-\/- ones. Similar experiments were conducted in BALB\/c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle. Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals. In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart.

CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP. The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP. The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents. In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole, even at low doses, may cause prolongation of the QT interval, leading to TDP.

In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause. The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury.

This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours. The study involved 4 sessions. In 1 session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. All eye drops were given in a randomized order. In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05). The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide.

From Days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg\/day from Days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg\/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period. Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on Days 1, 2, and 25. RESULTS: Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. When single-dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect. There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group. Three subjects (2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects. Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment. The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar.

Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only. However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree. Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. Propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. Phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration.

Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis. Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis. However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age. Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry. Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases. Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency. Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics. Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies. Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively. We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs.

The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte
