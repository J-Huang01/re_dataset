In this paper, we develop a sequential procedure to monitor clinical trials against historical controls. When there is a strong ethical concern about randomizing patients to existing treatment because biological and medical evidence suggests that the new treatment is potentially superior to the existing one, or when the enrollment is too limited for randomization of subjects into experimental and control groups, one can monitor the trial sequentially against historical controls if the historical data with required quality and sample size are available to form a valid reference for the trial. This design of trial is sometimes the only alternative to a randomized phase III trial design that is intended but not feasible in situations such as above. Monitoring this type of clinical trial leads to a statistical problem of comparing two population means in a situation in which data from one population are sequentially collected and compared with all data from the other population at each interim look. The proposed sequential procedures is based on the sequential conditional probability ratio test (SCPRT) by which the conclusion of the sequential test would be virtually the same as that arrived at by a non-sequential test based on all data at the planned end of the trial. We develop the sequential procedure by proposing a Brownian motion that emulates the test statistic, and then proposing an SCPRT that is adapted to the special properties of the trial.CI - Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Early postoperative seizures are defined as those that appear within the first week after surgery and are a well-known and feared complication in patients with supratentorial brain tumors. Few studies have investigated the value of pharmacological prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative seizures in these patients and their outcome has not been consistent. Furthermore, the efficacy of the new generation of antiepileptic agents in the prophylaxis of perioperative seizures has not been assessed so far. We analyzed the data related to 150 patients harboring supratentorial brain gliomas with the aim to assess the efficacy of oxcarbazepine in preventing the occurrence or the recurrence of early postoperative seizures and its tolerability when it is rapidly titrated. Only four patients (2.7%) experienced seizures within the first week after surgery. Patients did not report disturbances during the titration phase. Regarding adverse events in the first week, six patients (4%) showed minor skin rash. Persistent symptomatic hyponatremia never occurred. Our data showed that oxcarbazepine can be a good alternative to traditional antiepileptic agents in the prevention of perioperative seizures being efficacy, ease of use (rapid titration in 3 days, not requiring close plasma concentration monitoring) and good tolerability (no major side effects during titration and during the first postoperative week) the key factors. Moreover, oxcarbazepine can be a valid choice when long-term therapy is required because of the low interaction with other drugs and the low hematological side effects."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of rituximab (RTX) for systemic symptoms in patients with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (pSS), and changes in B cell biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 16 patients with pSS according to the American European consensus group criteria were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients, all women, had a median age of 58.5 (range 41-71) years and a disease duration of 9.5 (range 0-25) years. RTX was prescribed for lymphoma (n = 5), refractory pulmonary disease with polysynovitis (n = 2), severe polysynovitis (n = 2), mixed cryoglobulinaemia (n = 5), thrombocytopenia (n = 1) and mononeuritis multiplex (n = 1). The median follow-up duration was 14.5 (range 2-48) months. Three patients experienced adverse events, including one mild serum sickness-like reaction with the presence of human antichimeric antibodies. Efficacy of treatment was observed in 4 of 5 patients with lymphomas and in 9 of 11 patients with systemic involvement. Dryness was improved in only a minority of patients. Corticosteroid dose was reduced in 11 patients. RTX induced decreased rheumatoid factor, gamma-globulin and beta2-microglobulin levels, and the level of B cell activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor family (BAFF) increased concomitantly with B cell depletion. Five patients were re-treated, with good efficacy and tolerance, except for one with probable serum sickness-like reaction. CONCLUSION: This study shows good efficacy and fair tolerance of RTX for systemic features. In addition, RTX allows for a marked reduction in corticosteroid use. Except for BAFF, the level of which increases, serum B cell biomarker levels decrease after taking RTX. Controlled trials should be performed to confirm the efficacy of RTX in pSS."

Perturbations to the Wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in a large proportion of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Activating beta-catenin mutations and loss of function mutations in Axin1 are thought to be functionally equivalent. We examined the Wnt pathway in HCC by comparing the expression of beta-catenin target genes and the level of beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation, in 45 HCC tumors and four cell lines. Among these samples, beta-catenin and AXIN1 were mutated in 20 and seven cases, respectively. We found a significant correlation between activated beta-catenin mutations and overexpression of mRNA for the target genes glutamine synthetase (GS), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)49 and glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 (P=0.0001), but not for the genes ornithine aminotransferase, LECT2, c-myc and cyclin D1. We also showed that GS is a good immunohistochemical marker of beta-catenin activation in HCC. However, we observed no induction of GS, GPR49 or GLT-1 in the five inactivated Axin1 tumors. Beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation in two Axin1-mutated HCC cell lines was much weaker than in beta-catenin-mutated cell lines. Our results strongly suggest that in HCC, contrary to expectation, the loss of function of Axin1 is not equivalent to the gain of function of beta-catenin. Our results also suggest that the tumor suppressor function of Axin1 in HCC may be related to another, non-Wnt pathway."

Ionizing radiation elicits signaling events that coordinate DNA repair and interruption of cell cycle progression. We previously demonstrated that ionizing radiation (IR) of cells activates nuclear protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) by promoting dephosphorylation of Thr320, an inhibitory site in the enzyme and that the ATM kinase is required for this response. We sought to identify potential targets of IR-activated PP1. Untreated and IR-treated Jurkat cells were labeled with (32)P orthophosphate, and nuclear extracts were subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography to recover phosphatase complexes that were analyzed by 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Several proteins associated with protein phosphatases demonstrated a significant decrease in (32)P intensity following IR, and one of these was identified as HDAC1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed complexes containing PP1 with HDAC1 and Rb in cell extracts. In response to IR, there was an ATM-dependent activation of PP1, dephosphorylation of HDAC1, dissociation of HDAC1-PP1-Rb complexes and increased HDAC1 activity. These results suggest that IR regulates HDAC1 phosphorylation and activity through ATM-dependent activation of PP1."

Genes responsible for circadian rhythm are also involved in cancer-related biological pathways as potential tumor suppressors. However, no previous studies have examined associations between circadian genes and NHL risk. In this population-based case control study (n = 455 cases; 527 controls), we examined the only identified nonsynonymous polymorphism (Ala394Thr; rs2305160) in the largest circadian gene, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), in order to examine its impact on NHL risk. Our results demonstrate a robust association of the variant Thr genotypes (Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr) with reduced risk of NHL (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.85, p = 0.001), especially B-cell lymphoma (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, p <or= 0.0001). These findings provide the first molecular epidemiologic evidence supporting a role of circadian genes in lymphomagenesis, which suggests that genetic variations in circadian genes might be a novel panel of promising biomarkers for NHL and warrants further investigation.CI - (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

There were nominally significant differences between the two groups in their allelic frequencies (T Ins/Del, chi2=4.910, d.f.=1, P=0.040) and genotypic distributions (T/T or T/Del, chi2=5.116, d.f.=1, P=0.036) of rs3840846 in the 5'-upstream of NPTN. The two groups differed significantly also in their allelic frequencies (G/T, chi2=4.229, d.f.=1, P=0.044), but not genotypic distributions of rs3743500 in the 5'-upstream of NPTN. The haplotypes constructed from the three SNPs (rs3840846, rs3826047 and rs3743500, in order) in the 5'-upstream of NPTN showed a significant association with schizophrenia (permutation P=0.036), in that T-G-T (permutation P=0.028) and del-G-G (permutation P=0.040) were under-represented and over-represented, respectively, in schizophrenia. A reporter construct driven by the 5'-upstream region containing any haplotype consisting of the three SNPs had substantial transcriptional activity. Notably, a reporter construct containing a haplotype T-G-T had significantly lower transcriptional activity as compared with one having a haplotype T-G-G or T-A-G. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding allelic frequencies, genotypic distribution or the adopted SNP-combinatory haplotype for BSG.

The protein tyrosine phosphatase PEST (PTP-PEST) is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Despite the emerging functions attributed to both PTPs and the actin cytoskeleton in apoptosis, the involvement of PTP-PEST in apoptotic cell death remains to be established. Using several cell-based assays, we showed that PTP-PEST participates in the regulation of apoptosis. As apoptosis progressed, a pool of PTP-PEST localized to the edge of retracting lamellipodia. Expression of PTP-PEST also sensitized cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis. Concertedly, specific degradation of PTP-PEST was observed during apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibitors, immunodepletion experiments, and in vitro cleavage assays identified caspase-3 as the primary regulator of PTP-PEST processing during apoptosis. Caspase-3 specifically cleaved PTP-PEST at the (549)DSPD motif and generated fragments, some of which displayed increased catalytic activity. Moreover, caspase-3 regulated PTP-PEST interactions with paxillin, leupaxin, Shc, and PSTPIP. PTP-PEST acted as a scaffolding molecule connecting PSTPIP to additional partners: paxillin, Shc, Csk, and activation of caspase-3 correlated with the modulation of the PTP-PEST adaptor function. In addition, cleavage of PTP-PEST facilitated cellular detachment during apoptosis. Together, our data demonstrate that PTP-PEST actively contributes to the cellular apoptotic response and reveal the importance of caspases as regulators of PTPs in apoptosis."

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and function as ligand-modulated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in many important biological processes. The PPARdelta subtype has the highest expression in the brain and is postulated to play a major role in neuronal cell function; however, the precise physiological roles of this receptor remain to be elucidated. Herein, we show that the high-affinity PPARdelta agonists L-165041 [4-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)-propoxyl]phenoxy]-acetic acid] and GW501516 [2-methyl4-((4-methyl-2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1,3-triazol-5-yl)-methylsulfanyl)phenoxy acetic acid] protect against cytotoxin-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury in vitro and both ischemic brain injury and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity in vivo. In the SH-SY5Y studies, treatment with L-165041 or GW501516 significantly and concentration-dependently attenuated cell death following thapsigargin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, or staurosporine exposure, with the extent of damage correlated with the level of caspase-3 inhibition.

Moreover, the PPARdelta agonists also significantly attenuated MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine and related metabolite contents in mouse brain. These results demonstrate that subtype-selective PPARdelta agonists possess antiapoptotic properties in vitro, which may underlie their potential neuroprotective potential in in vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease (PD). These findings suggest that PPARdelta agonists could be useful tools for understanding the role of PPARdelta in other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as attractive therapeutic candidates for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as PD."

On the contrary, Fas is reported to advance the cell cycle in cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated roles of Fas in cell growth and apoptosis using human lung cancer cell lines. Fas was localized in the cytoplasm in exponentially growing cells, whereas only confluent cells expressed Fas on the cell membrane. A stimulation of confluent cells by either of EGF, IGF-I or VEGF induced once a decrease in Fas expression level and its sequential recovery. Fas expression levels in confluent cells were negatively correlated with cell doubling times (r=0.757, p=0.0088). Fas remained on the cell membrane of IgM-treated cells even after the growth factor stimulation, leading to apoptosis with abnormal mitosis, whereas the same stimulation induced Fas internalization in IgG(1)-treated cells. From these results, we suggest that Fas remaining on the cell membrane amplifies to induce apoptosis. Conversely, Fas internalization may enable cancer cells to escape from apoptosis. Our results suggest that growth factor may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis in an autocrine or paracrine fashion."

Astrocytes are critical for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and they play active roles in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic neurotransmission. In this report, to help elucidate the molecular events underlying Mn neurotoxicity, we systematically identified the molecular targets of Mn in primary human astrocytes at a genome-wide level, by using microarray gene expression profiling and computational data analysis algorithms. We found that Mn altered the expression of diverse genes ranging from those encoding cytokines and transporters to signal transducers and transcriptional regulators. Particularly, 28 genes encoding proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines and related functions were up-regulated, whereas 15 genes encoding functions involved in DNA replication and repair and cell cycle checkpoint control were down-regulated. Consistent with the increased expression of proinflammatory factors, analysis of common regulators revealed that 16 targets known to be positively affected by the interferon-gamma signaling pathway were up-regulated by Mn(2+). In addition, 68 genes were found to be similarly up- or down-regulated by both Mn(2+) and hypoxia. These results from genomic analysis are further supported by data from real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometric and toxicological analyses. Together, these analyses show that Mn(2+) selectively affects cell cycle progression, the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes, and the expression of proinflammatory factors in primary human astrocytes. These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Mn neurotoxicity."

Gene therapy of cancer using adenovirus as a single treatment modality has met limited success and efforts to enhance therapeutic outcomes have included combination of gene therapy with chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to investigate which chemotherapeutic agents may be suitable for combination with gene therapy of prostate cancer. Using an adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), we determined the effect of cisplatin, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, depsipeptide and MS-275 on adenoviral infectivity and transgene expression in LNCaP cells. We found that the two histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), depsipeptide and MS-275, and to a lesser extent doxorubicin, increased infectivity and transgene expression. However, only the HDACi selectively increased infectivity in LNCaP cells while doxorubicin increased infectivity to a greater extent in normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC). The increase in infectivity but not transgene expression correlated to increased surface expression of coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Increased transgene expression following infection with an adenovirus expressing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) was observed only in LNCaP cells treated with depsipeptide or MS-275. Combination of TRAIL gene therapy with HDACi but not doxorubicin resulted in increased induction of apoptosis in LNCaP cells. In contrast, apoptosis was not enhanced by HDACi in normal PrEC. These results suggest that combination of HDACi with adenoviral TRAIL gene therapy may be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer that warrants further investigation."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of temporary dry eye and the effects on lacrimal gland tear production after treatment of lateral canthal rhytids with botulinum toxin type A injections. METHODS: Twenty-six crow's feet areas were injected with botulinum toxin type A in 13 women with an age range of 31 to 58 years. A total of 10 units of botulinum toxin was injected per side, with two separate injections. Schirmer 1 testing was performed before and at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months after the injections in all patients. The test was repeated at 6 months and 9 months for the patients whose Schirmer test results were not back to baseline at the 4-month follow-up. Statistical significance was evaluated with paired t test analysis. RESULTS: Overall, no statistical difference was found in Schirmer test results from baseline at 1 week (p = 0.23), 1 month (p = 0.32), or 4 months (p = 0.30) after injection. Five eyes of three patients had a significant decrease in Schirmer test results from baseline at 1 week and 1 month after injection. Three eyes of 2 patients had a significant decrease in Schirmer test results at 4 months after injection. Only one patient reported dry-eye symptoms at the 4-month follow-up. Schirmer test results of two eyes of one patient remained significantly lower than baseline at 6 months follow-up, which returned to the normal range at 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin for lateral canthal rhytids usually does not suppress tear production. However, decreased tear production after botulinum toxin injection for crow's feet is a possible complication and patients should be advised of the small but definite risk of a temporary dry eye."

In this study, the associations of novel LRP5 variants with BMD variation were detected and some replicated in the two ethnic groups of Chinese and white origins, respectively. These data support the concept that LRP5 variation can contribute to minor and major variation in bone structure. INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene have been shown to cause both high and low bone mass. However, it is still controversial whether LRP5 is associated with normal BMD variation. This study explored the association of LRP5 with BMD phenotypes at three clinically important skeletal sites-the spine, hip, and ultradistal radius (UD)-in two independent populations of Chinese and white ethnicities, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Chinese sample consisted of 733 unrelated subjects. The white sample was made up of 1873 subjects from 405 nuclear families. High-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole LRP5 gene were genotyped and analyzed in both samples. RESULTS: Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses showed that the haplotype structures of LRP5 between Chinese and whites were in good agreement. Association tests showed that polymorphisms in block 5 spanning intron 7 to intron 19 of LRP5 significantly associated with spine BMD variation in both samples. Particularly, the significant association of SNP rs491347 in intron 7 with spine BMD in the Chinese sample (p=0.002) was replicated in whites, even after adjusting for multiple testing (p=0.005). Its strongly associated SNP rs1784235 could cause the loss of an estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding site in LRP5, which could partially explain the above replicated association. However, we did not observe any significant replication with BMD variation at the hip and UD. After accounting for multiple testing, associations with BMD variation at these two sites were mainly found in Chinese. Sex-stratified analyses further revealed that the LRP5 associations with BMD in Chinese and whites were driven by male and female subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our work supported LRP5 genetic variants as possible susceptibility factors for osteoporosis and fractures in humans. Especially, the SNP rs491347 and its strongly associated SNPs (e.g., rs1784235) could be important to human osteoporosis phenotypes."

Patients were randomized to prednisone for 10 days and either oral BDP 8 mg/d (n = 62) or placebo (n = 67) tablets for 50 days. At study day 10, prednisone was rapidly tapered while continuing study drug.

Among patients eligible for prednisone taper at study day 10, the risk of GVHD-treatment failure was significantly reduced at both study days 50 and 80 (HR 0.39 and 0.38, respectively). By day 200 after transplantation, 5 patients randomized to BDP had died compared with 16 deaths on placebo, a 67% reduction in the hazard of mortality (HR 0.33, P = .03). In 47 recipients of unrelated and HLA-mismatched stem cells, mortality at transplantation day 200 was reduced by 91% in the BDP group compared with placebo (HR 0.09, P = .02). The survival benefit was durable to 1 year after randomization. Oral BDP prevents relapses of gastrointestinal GVHD following tapering of prednisone; survival is statistically significantly better among patients receiving BDP."

Previous studies have identified a putative gene locus for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the chromosome 18q21 region. To identify candidate genes associated with these disorders we completed fine mapping analyses (using microsatellite markers) in 152 families from the Central Valley of Costa Rica (CVCR) (376 total subjects, 151 with a history of psychosis, 97 with a history of mania). Microsatellite analyses showed evidence of association at two contiguous markers, both located at the same genetic distance and spanning approximately 11 known genes. In a corollary gene expression study, one of these genes, malic enzyme 2 (ME2), showed levels of gene expression 5.6-fold lower in anterior cingulate tissue from post-mortem bipolar brains. Subsequent analysis of individual SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with the ME2 gene revealed one SNP and one haplotype associated with the phenotype of psychosis in the CVCR sample. ME2 interacts directly with the malate shuttle system, which has been shown to be altered in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and has roles in neuronal synthesis of glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid. The present study suggests that genetic variation in or near the ME2 gene is associated with both psychotic and manic disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."

There are certain 'hot-spots' in the p53 gene where mutations are commonly found that result in a mutated dipyrimidine site. This review discusses the role of p53 from normal function and its dysfunction in pre-cancerous lesions and non-melanoma skin cancers. Additionally, special situations are explored, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome in which there is an inherited p53 mutation, and the consequences of immune suppression on p53 mutations and the resulting increase in non-melanoma skin cancer in these patients."

METHODS: Gingival samples were collected from eight normal healthy individuals, eight patients with periodontitis, and eight patients with cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed for ET-1, ETA, and ETB. ET-1 protein was estimated from the tissues by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of ET-1 and its receptors was also examined in gingival fibroblast cells treated with CsA. RESULTS: ET-1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with CsA-induced gingival overgrowth (P <0.001) than in patients with periodontitis and the controls. ETA mRNA was expressed more than the ETB in all examined samples. In human gingival fibroblasts, ET-1 expression was increased with CsA incorporation compared to controls (P <0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CsA can modulate the expression of ET-1 in gingival fibroblasts and CsA-induced gingival overgrowth."

We studied how the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), one of the key molecules in the development of atherosclerosis, might be affected by paeonol in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Paeonol concentration-dependently inhibited the production of ICAM-1; it inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 translocation into the nucleus and the phosphorylation of inhibitory factor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha). It also blocked the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are involved in regulating ICAM-1 production by TNF-alpha. Paeonol inhibited U937 monocyte adhesion to HUVECs stimulated by TNF-alpha, suggesting that it may inhibit the binding of monocytes to endothelium by regulating the production of critical adhesion molecules by TNF-alpha. The inhibitory effect of paeonol on ICAM-1 production might be mediated by inhibiting p38, ERK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which are involved in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 production.

The alveolar macrophages stained positive by Periodic acid-Schiff. Diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) was made and drug-induced toxicity was suspected. SRL was withdrawn with marked improvement in the patients' clinical and radiological status. PAP resolved within 3 months without further therapy. PAP is a very rare complication of SRL therapy with only a few cases described. Withdrawal of SRL with conversion to another immunosuppressant seems to be an appropriate procedure in this condition."

We previously reported that microsomal inactivation kinetic parameters of diltiazem underpredicted CYP3A inactivation in hepatocytes. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of inactivation and reversible inhibition of CYP3A by diltiazem and its N-desmethyl (MA) and N,N-didesmethyl (MD) metabolites. In human liver microsomes, MA was a more potent time-dependent inactivator of CYP3A than its parent drug, with apparent k(inact) approximately 4-fold higher than that of diltiazem at a microsomal protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. MD did not inactivate CYP3A. Inactivation of CYP3A by diltiazem was dependent on microsomal protein concentration (25, 36, and 41% decrease in CYP3A activity at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml microsomal protein, respectively, incubated with 10 microM diltiazem over 20 min), whereas inactivation by MA did not seem to be protein concentration-dependent. MA and MD were reversible inhibitors of CYP3A with competitive Ki values of 2.7 and 0.2 microM, respectively. In cryopreserved hepatocytes incubated with diltiazem, time-dependent loss of CYP3A was accompanied by increased formation of MA and MD, with the MA level similar to its K(I) at higher diltiazem concentrations. In addition, the metabolites appeared to be accumulated inside the cells. In summary, time-dependent CYP3A inactivation by MA seems to be the major contributor responsible for the loss of CYP3A in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes incubated with diltiazem. These findings suggest that prediction of CYP3A loss based solely on microsomal inactivation parameters of parent drug may be inadequate."

Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome are related disorders associated with mutations in the CIAS1 gene. They appear to represent a continuum of one disease characterized by IL-1-mediated inflammation. Until recently, these conditions have been difficult to treat; however, with the advent of IL-1-receptor antagonist therapy, many reports of successful treatment of patients with these autoinflammatory diseases have emerged in the past 2 years. We describe an 8-year-old girl, diagnosed with Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, confirmed by presence of a novel CIAS1 mutation, who was refractory to symptomatic treatment. As frequent attacks of urticaria and associated arthralgia had a debilitating effect on the child's lifestyle, a trial of IL-1-receptor antagonist (anakinra) was instituted. Dramatic sustained clinical improvement was evident within days and serum amyloid and C-reactive protein levels normalized within a month. Although several authors have reported successful use of this agent in children with chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome, we believe ours is the first report of successful treatment with anakinra in a young child with familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome."

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of itraconazole, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. Two 6 day courses of either 200 mg itraconazole daily or placebo with at least a 4 week washout period were conducted. Thirteen volunteers took a single oral 20 mg dose of paroxetine on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of paroxetine were monitored up to 48 hours after the dosing. Compared with placebo, itraconazole treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of paroxetine by 1.3 fold (6.7 +/- 2.5 versus 9.0 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 48 hours [AUC (0-48)] of paroxetine by 1.5 fold (137 +/- 73 versus 199 +/- 91 ng*h/mL, P < 0.01). Although elimination half-life differed significantly (16.1 +/- 3.4 versus 18.8 +/- 5.9 hours, P < 0.05), the alteration was small (1.1 fold). The present study demonstrated that the bioavailability of paroxetine was increased by itraconazole, suggesting a possible involvement of P-glycoprotein in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine."

RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool for loss-of-function studies in mammalian cells and is also considered a potentially powerful therapeutic modality for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. During the past 3 years a number of systems for conditional RNAi have been developed that allow controlled expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) triggers of RNAi. The simplest strategy relies on tet-operable polymerase III-promoted shRNAs and co-expression of the tetracycline regulatory protein, TetR. In this study we have combined these features into a single lentiviral vector that upon delivery to target cells allows robust induction of shRNAs, even with low levels of doxycycline; importantly, we show minimal leakiness in the absence of inducer. We have exploited the regulatory properties of our system by targeting an essential cellular gene, the nuclear RNaseIII endonuclease Drosha. Drosha is the core catalytic component of the \"microprocessor complex\" and cleaves the primary microRNA (miRNA) transcripts into their pre-miRNA hairpin intermediates. We anticipate that our vector will facilitate functional studies of miRNA biogenesis."

ATM- and ATR-activated signaling pathways once appeared parallel, but new findings suggest that this cellular circuitry is highly interconnected. Communication between ATM and ATR enables the cell to respond to DNA strand breaks and inhibition of DNA synthesis with coordinated, highly modulated outputs.

We have adapted our established Alu PCR assay for proviral DNA and PCR for total cellular DNA to a real-time PCR format and applied these to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive specimens collected for routine determination of the plasma viral load (pVL). In a cohort of five patients, measurements of integrated viral load (iVL) and cell-associated viral load (cVL) in CD4(+) cells isolated by a single positive selection step were not indicative of HIV DNA levels in the circulation, and further analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In a cohort of 46 samples total cVL was quantitated in most samples, but iVL could be quantitated in only 47.8%, since in 26% iVL was undetectable and in 21.7% the results were invalid due to high levels of unintegrated HIV DNA. There was no correlation of cVL or iVL with pVL, CD4 count, or duration of successful antiretroviral treatment. Out of 26 patients with undetectable pVL, 4 patients failed therapy within the subsequent 12 months and had higher than average iVL, but this was not the case for cVL. Among nine patients with long-term undetectable pVL, no consistent decline in cVL or iVL was seen with time, and changes in cVL and iVL within a patient could be concordant or discordant. These results show that cVL and iVL can be coordinately measured in PBMC from clinical samples but do not correlate with pVL, CD4 counts, or length of suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Interestingly, a high iVL (but not a high cVL) in patients with undetectable pVL was associated with subsequent treatment failure."

We previously reported that some flavonoids have BCRP-inhibitory activity. Here we show the reversal effects of an extensive panel of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. METHODS: Reversal effects of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, or MRP1-mediated drug resistance were examined in the BCRP- or MDR1-transduced human leukemia K562 cells or in the MRP1-transfected human epidermoid carcinoma KB-3-1 cells using cell growth inhibition assays. The IC(50) values were determined from the growth inhibition curves. The RI(50) values were then determined as the concentration of inhibitor that causes a twofold reduction of the IC(50) in each transfectant. The reversal of BCRP activity was tested by measuring the fluorescence of intracellular topotecan. RESULTS: The BCRP-inhibitory activity of 32 compounds was screened, and 20 were found to be active. Among these active compounds, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone showed the strongest anti-BCRP activity with RI(50) values of 0.012 microM for SN-38 and 0.044 muM for mitoxantrone. We next examined the effects of a panel of 11 compounds on P-gp- and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. Two of the flavones, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone and acacetin, showed only low anti-P-gp activity, with the remainder displaying no suppressive effects against P-gp. None of the flavonoids that we tested inhibited MRP1. CONCLUSION: Our present results thus indicate that many flavonoids selectively inhibit BCRP only. Moreover, we examined the structure-BCRP inhibitory activity relationship from our current study."

In addition, significantly more adalimumab than placebo recipients achieved corticosteroid-free remission and had complete fistula closure.

Among the multiple cellular effects mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the effect on cell proliferation has extensively been investigated. A recent study showed that LPA-mediated proliferation of colon cancer cells requires activation of beta-catenin. However, the majority of colon cancer cells have deregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. This prompted us to hypothesize the presence of additional pathway(s) activated by LPA resulting in an increase in the proliferation of colon cancer cells. KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcriptional factor highly expressed in the crypt compartment of the intestinal epithelium. In this work, we investigated a role of KLF5 in LPA-mediated proliferation. We show that LPA stimulated the expression levels of KLF5 mRNA and protein in colon cancer cells and this stimulation was mediated by LPA(2) and LPA(3). Silencing of KLF5 expression by small interfering RNA significantly attenuated LPA-mediated proliferation of SW480 and HCT116 cells. LPA-mediated KLF5 induction was partially blocked by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and protein kinase C-delta. Moreover, we observed that LPA regulates KLF5 expression via eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k). Inhibition of calmodulin or silencing of eEF2k blocked the stimulation in KLF5 expression. Knockdown of eEF2k specifically inhibited KLF5 induction by LPA but not by fetal bovine serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results identify KLF5 as a target of LPA-mediated signaling and suggest a role of KLF5 in promoting proliferation of intestinal epithelia in response to LPA."

Pyridoxine dependent seizure (PDS) is a disorder of neonates or infants with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by seizures, which responds to pharmacological dose of pyridoxine. Recently, mutations have been identified in the ALDH7A1 gene in Caucasian families with PDS. To elucidate further the genetic background of PDS, we screened for ALDH7A1 mutations in five PDS families (patients 1-5) that included four Orientals. Diagnosis as having PDS was confirmed by pyridoxine-withdrawal test. Exon sequencing analysis of patients 1-4 revealed eight ALDH7A1 mutations in compound heterozygous forms: five missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, one point mutation at the splicing donor site in intron 1, and a 1937-bp genomic deletion. The deletion included the entire exon 17, which was flanked by two Alu elements in introns 16 and 17. None of the mutations was found in 100 control chromosomes. In patient 5, no mutation was found by the exon sequencing analysis. Furthermore, expression level or nucleotide sequences of ALDH7A1 mRNA in lymphoblasts were normal. Plasma pipecolic acid concentration was not elevated in patient 5. These observations suggest that ALDH7A1 mutation is unlikely to be responsible for patient 5. Abnormal metabolism of GABA/glutamate in brain has long been suggested as the underlying pathophysiology of PDS. CSF glutamate concentration was elevated during the off-pyridoxine period in patient 3, but not in patient 2 or 5. These results suggest allelic and non-allelic heterogeneities of PDS, and that the CSF glutamate elevation does not directly correlate with the presence of ALDH7A1 mutations."

Serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a lipolactonase that associates with HDL-apolipoprotein A-I (HDL-apoA-I) and thereby plays a role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Current sera tests make use of promiscuous substrates and provide no indications regarding HDL-PON1 complex formation. We developed new enzymatic tests that detect total PON1 levels, irrespective of HDL status and R/Q polymorphism, as well as the degree of catalytic stimulation and increased stability that follow PON1's tight binding to HDL-apoA-I. The tests are based on measuring total PON1 levels with a fluorogenic phosphotriester, measuring the lipolactonase activity with a chromogenic lactone, and assaying the enzyme's chelator-mediated inactivation rate. The latter two are affected by tight HDL binding and thereby derive the levels of the serum PON1-HDL complex. We demonstrate these new tests with a group of healthy individuals (n=54) and show that the levels of PON1-HDL vary by a factor of 12. Whereas the traditionally applied paraoxonase and arylesterase tests weakly reflect PON1-HDL levels (R=0.64), the lipolactonase test provides better correlation (R=0.80). These new tests indicate the levels and activity of PON1 in a physiologically relevant context as well as the levels and quality of the HDL particles with which the enzyme is associated."

Although the full-length Cab45 resides in Golgi lumen, we characterize a cytosolic splice variant, Cab45b, expressed in pancreatic acini. Cab45b is shown to bind (45)Ca(2+), and, of its three EF-hand motifs, EF-hand 2 is demonstrated to be crucial for the ion binding. Cab45b is shown to interact with Munc18b in an in vitro assay, and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of Ca(2+). In this assay, Cab45b also binds the Munc18a isoform in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The endogenous Cab45b in rat acini coimmunoprecipitates with Munc18b, syntaxin 2, and syntaxin 3, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors with key roles in the Ca(2+)-triggered zymogen secretion. Furthermore, we show that Munc18b bound to syntaxin 3 recruits Cab45b onto the plasma membrane. Importantly, antibodies against Cab45b are shown to inhibit in a specific and dose-dependent manner the Ca(2+)-induced amylase release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized acini.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia and/or health-risk behaviors among schizophrenic pregnant women were associated with an increased incidence of obstetric complications (OCs). METHOD: A high-risk birth cohort was formed by searching the Finnish Perinatal Register for all births from 1991-2000 with arterial cord pH values below 7.20, an indication of fetal asphyxia. This database was merged with national hospital discharge registries to determine psychiatric morbidity of the mothers and the mothers' first-degree relatives. Mothers were divided into 3 groups: women diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (n=53), mothers with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (n=590) and healthy controls (n=36,895). RESULT: Schizophrenic women had significantly more OCs than mothers with a first-degree schizophrenic relative and controls. These women had significantly increased rates of eclampsia, premature delivery, prenatal hospitalizations, and marginally significant increases in high blood pressure. Offspring of schizophrenic mothers had significantly decreased APGAR scores and birth weight and increased medical complications after birth. In contrast, women with a schizophrenic first-degree relative had no significant increases in OCs compared to controls. Schizophrenic mothers also smoked more than the other groups and smoking was found to mediate the relationship between maternal schizophrenic status and decreased birth weight among offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal schizophrenia during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of OCs, possibly due to engagement in health-risk behaviors during pregnancy, such as smoking, whereas genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, by itself, does not appear to be related to incidence of OCs."

A diagnosis of visceral varicella-zoster disease was made, and early intravenous ACV therapy successfully alleviated the epigastric pain and skin lesions within 2 weeks. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the serum showed dramatic decreases in the viral DNA copy number and revealed large viral concentrations prior to the skin manifestations.

We used data from 3 744 men aged 67-77 years from the city of Oslo that participated in the health screening for the Oslo II Health Study in 2000, to explore associations between C-reactive protein and environmental exposures including exposure to tobacco smoke products. Levels of C-reactive protein were higher in current smokers (2.05 mg/l, IQR, 1.11-4.17 mg/l), compared to former-smokers (1.58 mg/l, IQR, 0.83-3.03 mg/l) and non-smokers (1.26 mg/l, IQR, 0.65-2.40 mg/l). The risk of elevated C-reactive protein increased with both numbers of current cigarettes smoked per day and numbers of pack-years of smoking, when other factors were adjusted for (P < 0.001). We found a positive dose-response relationship between amount of current cigarette smoking and elevated C-reactive protein levels. These findings support the idea that the induction or exacerbation of inflammation could be a mechanism by which smoking promotes atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases."

In the present study, we elucidated the apoptotic mechanism of PPARgamma activation in human lung cancers by using a novel PPARgamma agonist, 1-(trans-methylimino-N-oxy)-6-(2-morpholinoethoxy)-3-phenyl-(1H-indene-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (KR-62980), and rosiglitazone. PPARgamma activation selectively inhibited cell viability of non-small-cell lung cancer with little effect on small-cell lung cancer and normal lung cells. The cell death induced by PPARgamma activation presented apoptotic features of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was accompanied by increased expression of proline oxidase (POX), a redox enzyme expressed in mitochondria, upon incubation with the agonists. POX RNA interference treatment blocked PPARgamma-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that POX plays a functional role in apoptosis through ROS formation. The apoptotic effects by the agonists were antagonized by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARgamma antagonist, and by knockdown of PPARgamma expression, indicating the involvement of PPARgamma in these actions. The results of the present study suggest that PPARgamma activation induces apoptotic cell death in non-small-cell lung carcinoma mainly through ROS formation via POX induction."

Ziprasidone monotherapy was administered for a period of eight weeks at a mean dose of 123.07+/-30.38 mg/day. Plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the study. A significant clinical improvement was observed, especially in negative symptoms ( P<0.05), and there was a significant improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms ( P<0.01). Clinical laboratory tests, such as ECG and weight, did not significantly change from baseline. Plasma ziprasidone levels ranged from 20 ng/mL to 160 ng/mL (mean: 75.8 ng/mL) and were significantly related to the improvement in negative symptoms. DISCUSSION: The study showed that ziprasidone was effective and tolerable, that use of ziprasidone was characterized by an absence of extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain, and that no alterations in clinical laboratory tests occurred. The findings suggest a relationship between plasma levels and the clinical response to negative symptoms of schizophrenia."

Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have been maligned in recent years because of concerns regarding their cardiovascular and overall safety profile. Specifically, it was widely publicised in the mid-1990s that these agents might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding and cancer. Data linking these agents with increased cardiovascular risk were based on nonrandomised studies and implicated short-acting, immediate-release agents. These results were inappropriately extrapolated to longer-acting compounds, extended-release products, and to the non-dihydropyridine class. Fortunately, recent studies have vindicated the class from safety allegations. These studies are reviewed herein. Compared with both diuretics and contemporary agents, amlodipine decreases cardiovascular events to a similar or greater extent without evidence for increased coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal bleeding or cancer. Despite these data, initial concerns have had lasting repercussions, as the use of dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists appears to lag behind what emerging data would support. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have several noteworthy attributes that merit consideration in the management of hypertension. The blood pressure response to this class of drugs is less contingent on patient factors such as age and race compared with other antihypertensive agents (e.g. ACE inhibitors). Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may exert effects that protect against stroke that are independent of their blood pressure-lowering mechanism. Unlike diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor anatagonists (beta-blockers), dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are lipid neutral and do not disturb glucose homeostasis. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists demonstrate a highly desirable profile when administered as part of combination therapy. Combinations of dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists display additive efficacy and an enviable adverse-effect profile. Collectively, the cardiovascular benefit, metabolic neutrality and homogeneous blood pressure response illuminated in recent studies, and reviewed here, represent a reaffirmation of the benefit of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and should serve to help reinforce the critical importance of these agents in the therapeutic armamentarium against cardiovascular disease."

In this study, we report that I602S, a common single nucleotide polymorphism within TLR1, is associated with aberrant trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface and diminished responses of blood monocytes to bacterial agonists. When expressed in heterologous systems, the TLR1 602S variant, but not the TLR1 602I variant, exhibits the expected deficiencies in trafficking and responsiveness. Among white Europeans, the 602S allele represents the most common single nucleotide polymorphism affecting TLR function identified to date.

Patients aged > 60 years or with increased infection risk received filgrastim 5 microg/kg per day in all R-CHOP cycles; other patients received filgrastim after a neutropenic event (no planned administration for cycle 1). RESULTS: Of 101 patients enrolled, 60 (59%) were aged > 60 years and received filgrastim in all cycles. Thirty-three patients aged <or= 60 years (80%) received filgrastim, 7 (17%) as primary use in cycle 1. Chemotherapy average relative dose intensity was comparable between age groups (91% > 60 years vs. 93% <or= 60 years). Overall response was similar in both groups (87% > 60 years vs. 95% <or= 60 years; P=0.19); however, the complete response rate was significantly lower for older patients (42% > 60 years vs. 71% <or= 60 years; P=0.005). Seventy-six percent of patients (75% > 60 years vs. 78% <or= 60 years) had no evidence of progression after 2 years of follow-up. Febrile neutropenia (fever >or= 38.3 degrees C with absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm) occurred in 17% of patients overall (22% > 60 years vs. 10% <or= 60 years), and 8% had cycle-1 events (12% > 60 years vs. 2% <or= 60 years). CONCLUSION: Patients aged > 60 years receiving R-CHOP with filgrastim support in all cycles received comparable doses of chemotherapy and had similar overall response rates compared wtih those of younger patients receiving no preemptive cycle-1 filgrastim."

In developed countries, 1 in 1,000 children is born with deafness severe enough to require special education services, and about 60% of the cases of isolated deafness have a genetic origin. Although more than 100 genes for hearing loss are known currently, only a few are routinely tested in the clinical practice. In this study, we present our findings from the molecular diagnostic screening of the GJB2 and GJB3 genes, del(GJB6-D13S1,830) and del(GJB6-D13S1,854) deletions in the GJB6 gene, Q829X mutation in the otoferlin gene (OTOF) and, the A1,555G and A7,445G mutations in the mitochondrial genome over an 8-year period. Mutations analysis in the previously mentioned genes and mutations was performed on 645 unrelated Brazilian patients with hearing loss who fell into two different testing groups. Different mutations in the GJB2 gene were responsible for most of cases studied, but deletions in the GJB6 gene as well as mitochondrial mutations were also found. While most cases of hearing loss in this country are due to environmental factors, the genetic etiology of deafness will increasingly be determined as more genetic tests become available.CI - (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc"

Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) levels are elevated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Anti-Abeta antibodies can reverse the histologic and cognitive impairments in mice which overexpress Abeta. Passive immunization appears safer than vaccination and treatment of patients will likely require human rather than xenogenic antibodies. Effective treatment will likely require antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, antibodies typically cross the BBB very poorly and accumulate less well in brain than even albumin, a substance nearly totally excluded from the brain. We compared the ability of two anti-Abeta human monoclonal IgM antibodies, L11.3 and HyL5, to cross the BBB of young CD-1 mice to that of young and aged SAMP8 mice. The SAMP8 mouse has a spontaneous mutation that induces an age-related, Abeta-dependent cognitive deficit. There was preferential uptake of intravenously administered L11.3 in comparison to HyL5, albumin, and a control human monoclonal IgM (RF), especially by hippocampus and olfactory bulb in aged SAMP8 mice. Injection of L11.3 into the brains of aged SAMP8 mice reversed both learning and memory impairments in aged SAMP8 mice, whereas IgG and IgM controls were ineffective. Pharmacokinetic analysis predicted that an intravenous dose 1000 times higher than the brain injection dose would reverse cognitive impairments. This predicted intravenous dose reversed the impairment in learning, but not memory, in aged SAMP8 mice. In conclusion, an IgM antibody was produced that crosses the BBB to reverse cognitive impairment in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease."

The melanocortin family of receptors (MC 1-5R) and their endogenous peptide ligands (alpha, beta, gamma- MSH and ACTH) have been implicated in the control of a wide variety of behavioral and physiological functions including the homeostatic control of food intake and body weight. In rodent models, melanocortin agonists including the nonselective peptide MTII have been shown to decrease food intake and body weight while antagonists such as SHU9119 and AGRP have been shown to stimulate food intake and increase body weight. Deletion of either the MC3R or MC4R in mice was found to be associated with obesity although hyperphagia was only observed in the MC4R deficient mice. Similarly in humans, inactivating mutations of the MC4R have been found in as many as six percent of obese individuals. The suggestion from these findings that activation of MC4Rs would have an anorectic effect in humans has resulted in efforts to produce selective agonists for the treatment of obesity. Over the past decade, efforts to develop MC4R selective small molecule and peptide agonists have been met with fractional success. Many small molecule agonists have been identified; however, few have been shown to have activity in vivo. While their use as therapeutics may have limitations, selective and potent peptide agonists have been shown by several investigators to decrease food intake and body weight in rodent models. The subject of the current review is to examine the progress made to date on producing both small molecule and peptide MC4R agonists as potential therapeutics for obesity."

AIM: To study the (functional) relevance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1, -2, -3, -9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, -2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), that may enhance susceptibility and/or disease severity. METHODS: Genomic DNA from 134 Crohn' s disease (CD), 111 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 248 control subjects was isolated from resected intestinal tissue or blood. Allelic composition at SNP loci was determined by PCR-RFLP or tetra primer ARMS PCR. RESULTS: The TIMP-1 genotype TT in women and T in men at SNP +372 T/C was found to increase CD susceptibility (39% vs 23.8%, P = 0.018 and 67.9% vs 51.6%, P = 0.055, respectively), while women with this genotype were less prone to development of fistulae during follow-up (41.4% vs 68.3%, P = 0.025). Male IBD or CD patients carrying the TIMP-1 +372 T-allele expressed lower levels of TIMP-1 in surgically resected macroscopically inflamed tissue (0.065 < P < 0.01). The 5T5T genotype at MMP-3 SNP -1613 5T/6T increased the chance of stenotic complications in CD during follow-up (91.2% vs 71.8%, P = 0.022) but seemed to protect against colonic involvement of this disease at first endoscopic/radiologic examination (35.3% vs 59.5%, P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Allelic composition at the examined SNPs in genes coding for TIMP-1 and MMP-3 affect CD susceptibility and/or phenotype, i.e., fistulizing disease, stricture pathogenesis and first disease localisation. These findings reinforce the important role of these proteins in IBD."

GLP-1 possesses neurotropic properties and can reduce amyloid protein levels in the brain. Based on extensive studies during the past decades, the understanding on AD leads us to believe that the primary targets in AD are the Abeta and tau protein. Combine these findings, GLP-1 is probably a promising agent in the therapy of AD. This review was focused on the biochemistry and physiology of GLP-1, communities between T2DM and AD, new progresses of GLP-1 in treating T2MD and improving some pathologic hallmarks of AD."

BACKGROUND: The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA contains regulatory elements that are essential for the appropriate expression of many genes. These regulatory elements are involved in the control of nuclear transport, polyadenylation status, subcellular targetting as well as rates of translation and degradation of mRNA. Indeed, 3'-UTR mutations have been associated with disease, but frequently this region is not analyzed. To gain insights into congenital heart disease (CHD), we have been analyzing cardiac-specific transcription factor genes, including GATA4, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor. Germline mutations in the coding region of GATA4 have been associated with septation defects of the human heart, but mutations are rather rare. Previously, we identified 19 somatically-derived zinc finger mutations in diseased tissues of malformed hearts. We now continued our search in the 609 bp 3'-UTR region of GATA4 to explore further molecular avenues leading to CHD. METHODS: By direct sequencing, we analyzed the 3'-UTR of GATA4 in DNA isolated from 68 formalin-fixed explanted hearts with complex cardiac malformations encompassing ventricular, atrial, and atrioventricular septal defects. We also analyzed blood samples of 12 patients with CHD and 100 unrelated healthy individuals. RESULTS: We identified germline and somatic mutations in the 3'-UTR of GATA4. In the malformed hearts, we found nine frequently occurring sequence alterations and six dbSNPs in the 3'-UTR region of GATA4. Seven of these mutations are predicted to affect RNA folding. We also found further five nonsynonymous mutations in exons 6 and 7 of GATA4. Except for the dbSNPs, analysis of tissue distal to the septation defect failed to detect sequence variations in the same donor, thus suggesting somatic origin and mosaicism of mutations. In a family, we observed c.+119A > T in the 3'-UTR associated with ASD type II. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that somatic GATA4 mutations in the 3'-UTR may provide an additional molecular rationale for CHD."

Treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels and also activates inhibitory AhR-ERalpha crosstalk associated with hormone-induced reporter gene expression. In ZR-75 cells grown under hypoxia, induction of these AhR-mediated responses by TCDD was significantly inhibited. This was not accompanied by decreased nuclear AhR levels or decreased interaction of the AhR complex with the CYP1A1 gene promoter as determined in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Hypoxia-induced loss of Ah-responsiveness was not associated with induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha or other factors that sequester the AhR nuclear translocation (Arnt) protein, and overexpression of Arnt under hypoxia did not restore Ah-responsiveness. The p65 subunit of NFkappaB which inhibits AhR-mediated transactivation was not induced by hypoxia and was primarily cytosolic in ZR-75 cells grown under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. In ZR-75 cells maintained under hypoxic conditions for 24 h, BRCA1 (an enhancer of AhR-mediated transactivation in breast cancer cells) was significantly decreased and this contributed to loss of Ah-responsiveness. In cells grown under hypoxia for 6 h, BRCA1 was not decreased, but induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD was significantly decreased. Cotreatment of ZR-75 cells with TCDD plus the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 6 h enhanced CYP1A1 expression in cells grown under hypoxia and normoxia. These results suggest that hypoxia rapidly induces protein(s) that inhibit Ah-responsiveness and these may be similar to constitutively expressed inhibitors of Ah-responsiveness (under normoxia) that are also inhibited by cycloheximide."

        "sentence": "Dynamic regulation of MTHFR mRNA expression and C677T genotype modulate mortality in coronary artery disease patients after revascularization. INTRODUCTION: A large body of evidence links plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations and cardiovascular disease. A common MTHFR polymorphism (C677T) leads to a variant with reduced activity and associated with increased Hcy levels. Coronary surgery precipitates a significant and sustained increase in the blood concentrations of Hcy and elevated levels of plasma Hcy have been associated to saphenous vein (SV) graft disease after CABG. However, the effects of MTHFR genotypes in the incidence of cardiovascular events after CABG have not been investigated prospectively. Here, we investigate whether MTHFR gene variants are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in individuals submitted to CABG. We also propose a molecular mechanism to explain our findings. METHODS: We performed MTHFR C677T genotypes in 558 patients with two or three vessel-disease and normal left ventricular function prospectively followed in the MASS II Trial, a randomized study to compare treatments for multivessel CAD and preserved left ventricle function. Follow-up time was 5 years. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and evaluated with the log-rank statistic. We assessed the relationship between baseline variables and the composite end-point of death, myocardial infarction and refractory angina using a Cox proportional hazards survival model. Finally, using an ex-vivo organ culture we have reproduced the arterialization of SV implants by culturing human SV either under venous hemodynamic condition (flow: 5 mL/min; no pressure) or arterial hemodynamic condition (flow: 50 mL/min; pressure: 80 mm Hg) for 1 day. MTHFR gene expression was quantified by real time RT-PCR in 15 SV from different individuals in both experimental conditions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among individuals within each genotype group for baseline clinical characteristics. A statistically significant association between the TT genotype, associated with increased serum levels of Hcy, and cardiovascular mortality after 5 years was verified (p=0.007) in individuals submitted to CABG surgery. In addition, MTHFR TT genotype was still significantly associated with a 4.4 fold increased risk in cardiovascular outcomes (p=0.01) even after adjustment of a Cox multivariate model for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and number of diseased vessels in this population. Finally, a significant reduction in MTHFR gene expression was demonstrated in human SV when submitted to an arterial hemodynamic condition (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There is a dynamic regulation of MTHFR gene expression during the arterialization process of human saphenous vein grafts resulting in lower levels of gene expression when in an arterial hemodynamic condition. In addition, the C677T MTHFR functional variant is associated with a worse outcome in individuals submitted to CABG. Taken together, these data suggest an important role of Hcy metabolism in individuals after CABG."

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently an association was shown between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11209026, within the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) locus and Crohn's disease (CD) as a consequence of a genome-wide association study of this disease in adults. We examined the effects of this and other previously reported SNPs at this locus with respect to CD in children. METHODS: By using data from our ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 142 pediatric CD patients and 281 matched controls, we investigated the association of the previously reported SNPs at the IL23R locus with the childhood form of this disease. RESULTS: By using the Fisher exact test, the minor allele frequency of rs11209026 in the patients was 1.75%, whereas it was 6.61% in the controls, yielding a protective odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.65; 1-sided P = 9.2 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, of all the SNPs previously reported, rs11209026 was associated the most strongly. A subsequent family based association test (which is more resistant to population stratification) with 65 sets of trios derived from our initial patient cohort yielded significant association with rs11209026 in a transmission disequilibrium test (1-sided P = .0017). In contrast, no association was detected to the caspase-recruitment domain 15 gene for the inflammatory bowel disease phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The OR of the IL23R variant in our pediatric study is highly comparable with that reported previously in a non-Jewish adult inflammatory bowel disease case-control cohort (OR, 0.26). As such, variants in the IL23R gene confer a similar magnitude of risk of CD to children as for their adult counterparts."

With the development of targeted therapeutics, especially for small-molecule inhibitors, it is important to understand whether the observed in vivo efficacy correlates with the modulation of desired/intended target in vivo. We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of all three vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Kit tyrosine kinases, pazopanib (GW786034), which selectively inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. It has good oral exposure and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice. Because bolus administration of the compound results in large differences in C(max) and C(trough), we investigated the effect of continuous infusion of a VEGFR inhibitor on tumor growth and angiogenesis. GW771806, which has similar enzyme and cellular profiles to GW786034, was used for these studies due to higher solubility requirements for infusion studies. Comparing the pharmacokinetics by two different routes of administration (bolus p.o. dosing and continuous infusion), we showed that the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of VEGFR inhibitors is dependent on steady-state concentration of the compound above a threshold. The steady-state concentration required for these effects is consistent with the concentration required for the inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs. Furthermore, the steady-state concentration of pazopanib determined from preclinical activity showed a strong correlation with the pharmacodynamic effects and antitumor activity in the phase I clinical trial."

It was determined that the reason why 491 of 20 817 persons (2.4%) applied during this term was because of poisoning: 159 (32.4%) of such patients were male and 332 of them (67.6%) were female. It was found that the average age of men was 27.1 +/- 10.5 years and that of women was 24.4 +/- 9.5 years (P = 0.005); 427 of poisoning cases (87.0%) happened intentionally as suicide attempts and 64 of them (13.0%) were accidental. The rate of suicide-purposed poisoning was higher in women and the rate of unintentional poisoning was higher in men (P +/- 0.001). The drugs were accountable for 71.1% of all poisoning cases and the pesticides were accountable for 18.9% of such cases. Poisonings increase during summers. The mortality rate in poisonings was found as 0.8%. The drugs and pesticides in Ckurova region constitute 90.0% of all poisoning cases. The mortality rate in poisoning will be decreased by training the physicians employed in the emergency department about poisoning by drugs and pesticides."

An involvement of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 channel in the regulation of body temperature (T(b)) has not been established decisively. To provide decisive evidence for such an involvement and determine its mechanisms were the aims of the present study. We synthesized a new TRPV1 antagonist, AMG0347 [(E)-N-(7-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-3-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], and characterized it in vitro. We then found that this drug is the most potent TRPV1 antagonist known to increase T(b) of rats and mice and showed (by using knock-out mice) that the entire hyperthermic effect of AMG0347 is TRPV1 dependent. AMG0347-induced hyperthermia was brought about by one or both of the two major autonomic cold-defense effector mechanisms (tail-skin vasoconstriction and/or thermogenesis), but it did not involve warmth-seeking behavior. The magnitude of the hyperthermic response depended on neither T(b) nor tail-skin temperature at the time of AMG0347 administration, thus indicating that AMG0347-induced hyperthermia results from blockade of tonic TRPV1 activation by nonthermal factors. AMG0347 was no more effective in causing hyperthermia when administered into the brain (intracerebroventricularly) or spinal cord (intrathecally) than when given systemically (intravenously), which indicates a peripheral site of action. We then established that localized intra-abdominal desensitization of TRPV1 channels with intraperitoneal resiniferatoxin blocks the T(b) response to systemic AMG0347; the extent of desensitization was determined by using a comprehensive battery of functional tests. We conclude that tonic activation of TRPV1 channels in the abdominal viscera by yet unidentified nonthermal factors inhibits skin vasoconstriction and thermogenesis, thus having a suppressive effect on T(b)."

Genetic variations increasing blood levels of acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of alcohol, refrain their carriers from drinking alcohol but may also put them at increased risk of cancer because of the mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of acetaldehyde. In a population-based study of 305 cases and 428 controls in Warsaw, Poland, we evaluated the effect of polymorphisms in alcohol metabolizing genes, including ADH1B (Ex9+5C>T, Ex3+23A>G, Ex3+58A>T and Ex9+77A>G), ADH1C (Ex8-56A>G and Ex6-14G>A) and ALDH2 (Ex1+82A>G), on levels of alcohol drinking and susceptibility of stomach cancer. We found that among control subjects frequency of alcohol drinking varied by alcohol metabolizing genotype. In particular, the weekly consumption of individuals carrying the AA, GA and GG genotypes of ALDH2 Ex1+82A>G polymorphism were 3.75, 2.26 and 1.53 drinks, respectively (p=0.04). However, none of the assessed polymorphisms in these 3 genes had a measurable effect on stomach cancer risk. When stratified by ALDH2 Ex1+82A>G polymorphism, alcohol-related increases in stomach cancer risk were restricted to individuals with the AG/GG genotypes, with a more than 2-fold risk among daily drinkers (OR=2.63, 95% CI=1.00-6.88) and 3-fold risk (OR=3.66, 95% CI=1.19-11.24) among those with 40 or more drink-years. In summary, our results suggested that the ALDH2 Ex1+82 G allele may be functionally deficient in eliminating acetaldehyde and discourage alcohol drinking. Furthermore, heavy drinkers of alcohol who were genetically prone to accumulate acetaldehyde may face an increased risk of stomach cancer.CI - Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

        "sentence": "Selective sigma-2 ligands preferentially bind to pancreatic adenocarcinomas: applications in diagnostic imaging and therapy. BACKGROUND: Resistance to modern adjuvant treatment is in part due to the failure of programmed cell death. Therefore the molecules that execute the apoptotic program are potential targets for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics. The sigma-2 receptor has been found to be over-expressed in some types of malignant tumors, and, recently, small molecule ligands to the sigma-2 receptor were found to induce cancer cell apoptosis. RESULTS: The sigma-2 receptor was expressed at high levels in both human and murine pancreas cancer cell lines, with minimal or limited expression in normal tissues, including: brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and spleen. Micro-PET imaging was used to demonstrate that the sigma-2 receptor was preferentially expressed in tumor as opposed to normal tissues in pancreas tumor allograft-bearing mice. Two structurally distinct sigma-2 receptor ligands, SV119 and WC26, were found to induce apoptosis to mice and human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Sigma-2 receptor ligands induced apoptosis in a dose dependent fashion in all pancreatic cell lines tested. At the highest dose tested (10 muM), all sigma-2 receptor ligands induced 10-20% apoptosis in all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested (p < 0.05). In pancreas tumor allograft-bearing mice, a single bolus dose of WC26 caused approximately 50% apoptosis in the tumor compared to no appreciable apoptosis in tumor-bearing, vehicle-injected control animals (p < 0.0001). WC26 significantly slowed tumor growth after a 5 day treatment compared to vehicle-injected control animals (p < 0.0001) and blood chemistry panels suggested that there is minimal peripheral toxicity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a novel therapeutic strategy that induces a significant increase in pancreas cancer cell death. This strategy highlights a new potential target for the treatment of pancreas cancer, which has little in the way of effective treatments."

We have done an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial to investigate the tissue-specific effects of 2.5 mg tibolone on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, in particular on tissue proliferation (STEM, Study of Tibolone Effects on Mamma carcinoma tissue). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Postmenopausal women with initially stage I/II, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) primary breast cancer, were randomly assigned to 14 days of placebo or 2.5 mg/d tibolone. Core biopsies of the primary tumor were obtained before and after treatment. Ki-67 and apoptosis index were analyzed in baseline and corresponding posttreatment specimen. RESULTS: Of 102 enrolled patients, 95 had evaluable data. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both treatment groups. Breast cancer cases are mainly invasive (99%), stage I or II (42% and 50% respectively), and ER+ (99%). Median intratumoral Ki-67 expression at baseline was 13.0% in the tibolone group and 17.8% in the placebo group, and decreased to 12.0% after 14 days of tibolone while increasing to 19.0% in the placebo group. This change from baseline was not significantly different between tibolone and placebo (Wilcoxon test; P=0.17). A significant difference was observed between the treatment groups when the median change from baseline apoptosis index was compared between the treatment groups (tibolone, 0.0%; placebo, +0.3%; Wilcoxon test; P=0.031). The incidence of adverse effects was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: In ER+ breast tumors, 2.5 mg/d tibolone given for 14 days has no significant effect on tumor cell proliferation."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Four patients were serologically positive for HEV; three had no traditional risk factors, the fourth had recently returned from China. All four consumed meat products. Liver histology of the three autochthonous (locally acquired) cases showed portal tracts expanded by a severe mixed polymorph and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, with a geographical distribution of polymorphs at the interface and lymphocytes centrally. Moderate to severe interface hepatitis and cholangiolitis were present. There was a striking acinar mixed inflammatory infiltrate made up of polymorphs, lymphocytes and macrophages; frequent apoptotic hepatocytes, focal necrosis, cholestatic rosettes and zone 3 canalicular and cytoplasmic bilirubinostasis were noted. Significant steatosis, megamitochondria and Mallory bodies were not present. There was no evidence of iron, copper or alpha(1)-antitrypsin accumulation. By contrast, the histology of the imported case of HEV infection showed less intense portal and acinar inflammation, no cholangiolitis and no geographical distribution of the portal inflammatory infiltrate. CONCLUSION: The histological appearances of autochthonous HEV infection are sufficiently distinctive to consider the diagnosis in an acute setting and possibly to differentiate it from the endemic form of the disease."

PURPOSE: A crossover study was carried out in 405 couples to compare women's difficulties with three different devices that could be used to administer a microbicide and to evaluate adherence to use and preference for any one of the devices. METHODS: Couples used a single size diaphragm, a vaginal ring or disposable applicators for 1 month each in a randomly assigned order. RESULTS: Few women reported difficulty using the applicators or the ring; however, almost two-thirds reported difficulty using the diaphragm. Approximately 5%, 10% and 40% of the women and a similar but slightly lower percentage of their partners reported incorrect use of the applicator, vaginal ring and diaphragm, respectively. About half the women preferred the vaginal ring, while around half the men preferred the applicator. CONCLUSION: The release of microbicides from a vaginal ring is a lead worth pursuing. The diaphragm is the only one of the three devices that also offers mechanical protection, but it requires greater investment in patient education to ensure adherence to use."

The most frequent and the most troublesome adverse effect of interferon plus ribavirin-based therapy is anaemia. The aim of this analysis was to determine the incidence and risk factors of anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients receiving anti-HCV therapy. We reviewed all cases of anaemia occurring among 416 patients participating in a randomized, controlled 48-week trial comparing peginterferon (peg-IFN) alpha 2b plus ribavirin with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify links with antiretroviral treatments, HCV therapy and clinical and laboratory findings. Sixty-one (15.9%) of the 383 patients who received at least one dose of anti-HCV treatment developed anaemia. In multivariate analysis the risk of anaemia was significantly associated with zidovudine (OR, 3.27 95% CI, 1.64-6.54, P = 0.0008) and peg-IFN (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.16-4.57, P = 0.0179). The risk of anaemia was lower in patients with higher baseline haemoglobin levels (OR, 0.35 95% CI, 0.26-0.49, P < 0.0001) and in patients receiving protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy (OR, 0.51 95% CI, 0.30-0.86, P = 0.0114). Zidovudine discontinuation could help to avoid anaemia associated with anti-HCV therapy."

The profiles of phase I metabolites were similar in human hepatocytes and microsomes. The metabolites of all three compounds produced in rat, dog and human microsomes and hepatocytes were similar to those seen in vivo, with the major routes of metabolism being N-dealkylation and/or hydroxylation. There was more extensive metabolic processing in hepatocytes than in microsomes; however, sequential metabolism was less extensive in vitro compared with in vivo. The pharmacokinetics of the three 5HT3 antagonists investigated were dominated by CYP3A4 (and/or 2C9) compared with CYP1A2 in man, possibly determined by enzyme capacity rather than relative enzyme affinity. These data support the use of rat, dog and human hepatocytes for the prediction of in vivo metabolites of ondansetron, alosetron and GR87442."

BACKGROUND: Enhanced removal of cisplatin-DNA adducts has been reported as one of main causes of cell resistance to cisplatin. This particular resistance mechanism may be circumvented by platinum complexes that bind differently to DNA. One line of work is focussed on trans platinum complexes, some of which exhibit antitumour activity similar to or even higher than that of their cis counterparts. METHODS: We synthesised new trans platinum complexes, trans-[PtCl2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)] and trans-[PtCl2(OH)2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)], previously evaluated as cytotoxic agents towards different cancer and normal cell lines. These trans platinum compounds were highly effective against a panel of tumoral cell lines either sensitive to or with acquired resistance to cisplatin. RESULTS: In the present work we examined the mechanisms induced by these compounds to cause tumour cells toxicity. We have found that these compounds induced a complete blockade at the S phase of the cell cycle inhibiting total mRNA transcription and precluding p53 activation. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other DNA-damaging agents, these compounds do not induce senescence-associated permanent arrest. Furthermore, only a small percentage of these cells enter into apoptosis, with most of the population dying by a necrosis-like mechanism."

In this study we show that Bcl-2 and Bim each control the expression of the other. Absence of Bim leads to a drop in the amount of intracellular Bcl-2 protein, while having no effect on the amounts of mRNA for Bcl-2. Conversely, high amounts of Bcl-2 per cell allow high amounts of Bim, although in this case the effect involves increases in Bim mRNA. These mutual effects occur even if Bcl-2 is induced acutely.

The finding that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) suppresses inflammation in peripheral macrophages and in models of human autoimmune disease instigated the evaluation of this salutary action for the treatment of CNS disorders with an inflammatory component. The fact that NSAIDs delay the onset of and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), while also binding to and activating PPARgamma, led to the hypothesis that one dimension of NSAID protection in AD is mediated by PPARgamma. Several lines of evidence from experiments using AD-related transgenic cellular and animal models have supported this hypothesis. The capacity of PPARgamma agonists to elicit anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenic and insulin-sensitizing effects might account for their observed protective effects. Several clinical trials employing PPARgamma agonists have yielded promising results, and further trials are in preparation. Positive outcomes following PPARgamma administration have been obtained in animal models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, both of which are associated with a considerable degree of neuroinflammation. Finally, activation of PPARgamma has been found to be protective in several models of multiple sclerosis. The verification of these findings in human cells prompted the initiation of clinical studies evaluating PPARgamma activation in patients with multiple sclerosis."

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) play a prominent role in cartilage tissue homeostasis and perturbations of BMP signaling contribute to pathological processes like osteoarthritis. The response to BMP is determined by intracellular proteins interacting with the signal mediators Smads 1 and 5. Applying the yeast two-hybrid technique we could identify the actin-binding protein calponin 3 as a novel Smad-binding protein expressed in chondrocytes. It interacted with Smads 1 and 5 and overexpression led to an attenuation of BMP-dependent transcription. Calponin 3 mRNA and protein were expressed in cartilage tissue and isolated chondrocytes and a slight, but statistically significant reduction of mRNA expression levels could be detected in osteoarthritic cartilage. Our results suggest a role of calponin 3 in the regulation of BMP-dependent cellular responses. By interaction with the Smad proteins 1 and 5 and the inhibition of BMP-induced transcription, calponin 3 provides a negative regulatory mechanism for the BMP signaling pathway. This inhibitory effect likely depends on a sequestration of the Smads to the cytoskeleton due to the actin-binding properties of calponin 3. The down-regulation of calponin 3 expression in osteoarthritic joints could contribute to the increased responsiveness to BMPs described previously. Furthermore, our data provide a possible explanation for the effect of the related protein calponin 1 on bone and cartilage development."

A qualitative syber green real-time PCR with primers designed for a truncated portion of the 56kDa major outer membrane antigen gene of Orientia tsutsugamushi was used to diagnose scrub typhus from the blood or serum of suspected patients. Sixty-six blood and/or sera samples from fever cases, either with high index of suspicion for scrub typhus and/or positive by Weil-Felix test (> or = 1:160), were tested with the PCR. Specificity of the PCR was confirmed by end point melt curve analysis and sequencing of the amplicons. A nested PCR for determination of the serotypes of O. tsutsugamushi was performed on to the samples. In real-time PCR strong positive fluorescence was obtained in 73% of the suspected samples. Serotype-specific PCR amplification of some of the positive samples was indicative of the Kuroki type whereas the rest were non-responsive to this test. Sequence analyses of PCR amplicons indicated the presence of new, previously undescribed type of O. tsutsugamushi in this region. This one-step real-time PCR can be used for the detection and confirmation of scrub typhus, when used independently or in conjunction with, the Weil-Felix test, which is still the only available detection test for scrub typhus in most parts of the developing world.

Doxorubicin is among the most effective and widely used anticancer drugs in the clinic. However, cardiotoxicity is one of the life-threatening side effects of doxorubicin-based therapy. Dexrazoxane (Zinecard, also known as ICRF-187) has been used in the clinic as a cardioprotectant against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The molecular basis for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane, however, is not fully understood. In the present study, we showed that dexrazoxane specifically abolished the DNA damage signal gamma-H2AX induced by doxorubicin, but not camptothecin or hydrogen peroxide, in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage was also specifically abolished by the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132 and much reduced in top2beta(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) compared with TOP2beta(+/+) MEFs, suggesting the involvement of proteasome and DNA topoisomerase IIbeta (Top2beta). Furthermore, in addition to antagonizing Top2 cleavage complex formation, dexrazoxane also induced rapid degradation of Top2beta, which paralleled the reduction of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. Together, our results suggest that dexrazoxane antagonizes doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through its interference with Top2beta, which could implicate Top2beta in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The specific involvement of proteasome and Top2beta in doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is consistent with a model in which proteasomal processing of doxorubicin-induced Top2beta-DNA covalent complexes exposes the Top2beta-concealed DNA double-strand breaks."

We measured in 60 hypercholesterolemic patients and 20 controls plasma total sRAGE levels, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) excretion, and plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The effects of two structurally different statins (pravastatin and atorvastatin) on these parameters were analyzed in 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects free of vascular disease. Plasma sRAGE was significantly lower, ADMA and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) were higher, in hypercholesterolemic versus normocholesterolemic patients. Patients on statin treatment with previous myocardial infarction had lower 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), higher sRAGE, and unchanged ADMA levels compared to subjects free of vascular disease. On multivariate regression analysis only 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and ADMA predicted sRAGE levels. An 8-week treatment with either statin was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), whereas only atorvastatin raised sRAGE levels near to normal values, with no change in ADMA levels. sRAGE might serve as an endogenous protecting factor for accelerated atherosclerosis mediated by oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia."

BACKGROUND: Exposure to Benzodiazepines (BZD) during foetal life has been suggested to contribute to neonatal morbidity and some congenital malformations, for example, orofacial clefts. Here we aimed to study the neonatal outcome and congenital malformations in neonates whose mothers reported use of BZD and/or hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists (HBRA) during pregnancy. METHODS: In the Swedish Medical Birth Register we identified 1979 infants whose mothers (n = 1944) reported use of BZD and/or HBRA in early pregnancy. An additional 401 infants were studied, born to 390 mothers who were prescribed such drugs during late pregnancy. Neonatal outcome including congenital malformations after exposure was compared with that of all births (n = 873 879). RESULTS: An increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight was detected in the exposed population. The rate of relatively major congenital malformations was moderately increased among infants exposed in early pregnancy (adjusted OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.00-1.55), not explained by known teratogenic maternal co-medication. A higher than expected number of infants with pylorostenosis or alimentary tract atresia (especially small gut) was found. This was, however, based on only seven infants for each group of malformation without association to any specific BZD or HBRA. The earlier proposed increased risk for orofacial clefts was not confirmed in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal use of BZD and/or HBRA may increase the risk for preterm birth and low birth weight and cause neonatal symptoms, but does not appear to have a strong teratogenic potential. The tentative association with pylorostenosis and alimentary tract atresia needs confirmation."

        "sentence": "Hypomorphic CEP290/NPHP6 mutations result in anosmia caused by the selective loss of G proteins in cilia of olfactory sensory neurons. Cilia regulate diverse functions such as motility, fluid balance, and sensory perception. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) compartmentalize the signaling proteins necessary for odor detection; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms of protein sorting/entry into olfactory cilia. Nephrocystins are a family of ciliary proteins likely involved in cargo sorting during transport from the basal body to the ciliary axoneme. In humans, loss-of-function of the cilia-centrosomal protein CEP290/NPHP6 is associated with Joubert and Meckel syndromes, whereas hypomorphic mutations result in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a form of early-onset retinal dystrophy. Here, we report that CEP290-LCA patients exhibit severely abnormal olfactory function. In a mouse model with hypomorphic mutations in CEP290 [retinal dystrophy-16 mice (rd16)], electro-olfactogram recordings revealed an anosmic phenotype analogous to that of CEP290-LCA patients. Despite the loss of olfactory function, cilia of OSNs remained intact in the rd16 mice. As in wild type, CEP290 localized to dendritic knobs of rd16 OSNs, where it was in complex with ciliary transport proteins and the olfactory G proteins G(olf) and Ggamma(13). Interestingly, we observed defective ciliary localization of G(olf) and Ggamma(13) but not of G protein-coupled odorant receptors or other components of the odorant signaling pathway in the rd16 OSNs. Our data implicate distinct mechanisms for ciliary transport of olfactory signaling proteins, with CEP290 being a key mediator involved in G protein trafficking. The assessment of olfactory function can, therefore, serve as a useful diagnostic tool for genetic screening of certain syndromic ciliary diseases."

        "sentence": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is associated with decreased expression of mucosal interleukin 22 receptor. INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an inflammatory disorder of the sinonasal mucosa that is frequently associated with microbial colonization. Innate defense mechanisms at the mucosal surface are critical in protecting the host from airborne environmental pathogens. Recent studies of skin and gastrointestinal tract inflammatory diseases have shown that stimulation of the interleukin-22 receptor (IL-22R1) nonspecifically increases innate immune responses. The potential role of IL-22R1 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP has never been explored. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. METHODS: Nine controls and 19 subjects with CRS were prospectively enrolled prior to undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Nasal epithelial cells were cultured from surgically obtained ethmoid mucosa and IL-22R1 protein expression was examined via flow cytometry. RNA was extracted from whole mucosal samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine expression of IL22 and IL-22R1. Subjects were followed for at least 6 months postoperative to assess for recurrence or persistence of polyps. RESULTS: Flow cytometry demonstrated the expression of IL-22R1 protein on the surface of cultured nasal epithelial cells. IL-22R1 mRNA was expressed in 100% of the controls and CRSsNP. However, IL-22R1 was only expressed in 55% of patients with recalcitrant CRSwNP. Additionally, levels of IL22R1 were significantly lower in recalcitrant CRSwNP compared to controls and CRSsNP. IL22 levels did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate IL-22R1 mRNA and protein expression on nasal epithelial cells. Failure of medical and surgical therapy in CRSwNP is associated with significantly decreased expression of IL-22R1. Further research is needed to determine the potential of IL-22R1 as a therapeutic target in CRSwNP."

D(3) dopamine receptors are expressed by dopamine neurons and are implicated in the modulation of presynaptic dopamine neurotransmission. The mechanisms underlying this modulation remain ill defined. The dopamine transporter, which terminates dopamine transmission via reuptake of released neurotransmitter, is regulated by receptor- and second messenger-linked signaling pathways. Whether D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function is unknown. We addressed this issue using a fluorescent imaging technique that permits real time quantification of dopamine transporter function in living single cells. Accumulation of the fluorescent dopamine transporter substrate trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)) in human embryonic kidney cells expressing human dopamine transporter was saturable and temperature-dependent. In cells co-expressing dopamine transporter and D3 receptors, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole produced a rapid, concentration-dependent, and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase of ASP(+) uptake. Similar agonist effects were observed in Neuro2A cells and replicated in human embryonic kidney cells using a radioligand uptake assay in which binding to and activation of D3 receptors by [(3)H]dopamine was prevented. D3 receptor stimulation activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK. Inhibition of either kinase prevented the quinpirole-induced increase in uptake. D3 receptor activation differentially affected dopamine transporter function and subcellular distribution depending on the duration of agonist exposure. Biotinylation experiments revealed that the rapid increase of uptake was associated with increased cell surface and decreased intracellular expression and increased dopamine transporter exocytosis. In contrast, prolonged agonist exposure reduced uptake and transporter cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function and identify a novel mechanism by which D3 receptors regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations."

BACKGROUND: Recent investigations in developed countries have found marked increases in the prevalence of allergic conditions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine recent time trends in the prevalence of anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria by describing trends and age and sex differentials in hospitalizations for these conditions in Australia. METHODS: Data on hospital admissions and deaths for anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria were extracted for the periods 1993-1994 to 2004-2005 and 1997-2004, respectively. For hospital admissions, age-standardized rates were calculated. Time trends and sex differences were quantified by using negative binomial models. RESULTS: During the study period, there was a continuous increase in the rate of hospital admissions for angioedema (3.0% per year), urticaria (5.7% per year), and, most notably, anaphylaxis (8.8% per year). There was a particularly steep increase in the incidence of hospitalization for food-related anaphylaxis among children aged less than 5 years. Admissions for non-food-related anaphylaxis occurred predominantly in adults, particularly those more than 35 years of age. Among children, admission rates were higher in boys, but the sex difference was reversed among adults. Over an 8-year period, there were 106 deaths associated with anaphylaxis or angioedema. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates for allergic conditions are on the increase, but the nature and causative factors differ between adults and children. The relation of these changes to those in the prevalence of specific allergen sensitization in the community requires further investigation in population studies. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Among older persons, angioedema is becoming an increasing problem. Among children, hospitalization because of food-induced anaphylaxis is a growing concern."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulation of the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2/BRCP1 drug transporter by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity, and to determine whether gefitinib, an EGFR small molecule inhibitor, will modulate the effects of doxorubicin hydrochloride by inhibiting its extrusion from thyroid cancer cells. DESIGN: Extrusion assays using flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the ability of thyroid cancer cells to extrude the chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin, via the ABCG2 drug transporter in the presence or absence of gefitinib. Immunofluorescence was employed to determine the cellular expression of ABCG2. The ABCG2 expression in ARO and WRO cell lines was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Inactivation of EGFR kinase by gefitinib was analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay was performed to demonstrate ABCG2-mediated apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin. Colony formation assays were performed to determine the effect of gefitinib on thyroid cancer cell survival in response to gefitinib, doxorubicin, or the combination of both drugs. RESULTS: Inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by gefitinib causes the translocation of the ABCG2 drug transporter away from the plasma membrane, resulting in a concomitant decrease in doxorubicin extrusion in thyroid cancer cell lines. Both ARO and WRO demonstrated differential ABCG2 expression, whereas both were sensitized to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis on ABCG2 knockdown with short interfering RNA. The addition of gefitinib increases doxorubicin-induced cell death in thyroid cancer cells as measured by colony formation assay. CONCLUSIONS: Epidermal growth factor receptor regulates the function of the drug transporter ABCG2/BCRP1 and correlates with ABCG2 protein expression levels. Inactivation of the EGFR kinase by gefitinib potentiates the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in thyroid cancer, most likely by decreasing the ability of the cell to extrude doxorubicin. The expression of ABCG2 may explain in part the ineffectiveness of doxorubicin as a single modality treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or for treatment of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer. Use of this combination treatment of gefitinib and doxorubicin may be a promising therapy for anaplastic thyroid and metastatic follicular thyroid cancer and needs to be investigated further."
