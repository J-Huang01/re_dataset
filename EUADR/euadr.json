When there is a strong ethical concern about randomizing patients to existing treatment because biological and medical evidence suggests that the new treatment is potentially superior to the existing one, or when the enrollment is too limited for randomization of subjects into experimental and control groups, one can monitor the trial sequentially against historical controls if the historical data with required quality and sample size are available to form a valid reference for the trial. This design of trial is sometimes the only alternative to a randomized phase III trial design that is intended but not feasible in situations such as above. Monitoring this type of clinical trial leads to a statistical problem of comparing two population means in a situation in which data from one population are sequentially collected and compared with all data from the other population at each interim look. The proposed sequential procedures is based on the sequential conditional probability ratio test (SCPRT) by which the conclusion of the sequential test would be virtually the same as that arrived at by a non-sequential test based on all data at the planned end of the trial. We develop the sequential procedure by proposing a Brownian motion that emulates the test statistic, and then proposing an SCPRT that is adapted to the special properties of the trial.CI - Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."],"offsets":[[83,1600]]}],"entities":[],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":1,"row":{"id":"4","document_id":"4","passages":[{"id":"5","type":"title","text":["Prevention of early postoperative seizures in patients with primary brain tumors: preliminary experience with oxcarbazepine."],"offsets":[[0,124]]},{"id":"6","type":"abstract","text":["Early postoperative seizures are defined as those that appear within the first week after surgery and are a well-known and feared complication in patients with supratentorial brain tumors. Few studies have investigated the value of pharmacological prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative seizures in these patients and their outcome has not been consistent. Furthermore, the efficacy of the new generation of antiepileptic agents in the prophylaxis of perioperative seizures has not been assessed so far. We analyzed the data related to 150 patients harboring supratentorial brain gliomas with the aim to assess the efficacy of oxcarbazepine in preventing the occurrence or the recurrence of early postoperative seizures and its tolerability when it is rapidly titrated. Only four patients (2.7%) experienced seizures within the first week after surgery. Patients did not report disturbances during the titration phase. Regarding adverse events in the first week, six patients (4%) showed minor skin rash. Persistent symptomatic hyponatremia never occurred. Our data showed that oxcarbazepine can be a good alternative to traditional antiepileptic agents in the prevention of perioperative seizures being efficacy, ease of use (rapid titration in 3 days, not requiring close plasma concentration monitoring) and good tolerability (no major side effects during titration and during the first postoperative week) the key factors. Moreover, oxcarbazepine can be a valid choice when long-term therapy is required because of the low interaction with other drugs and the low hematological side

syndrome (pSS), and changes in B cell biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 16 patients with pSS according to the American European consensus group criteria were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patients, all women, had a median age of 58.5 (range 41-71) years and a disease duration of 9.5 (range 0-25) years. RTX was prescribed for lymphoma (n = 5), refractory pulmonary disease with polysynovitis (n = 2), severe polysynovitis (n = 2), mixed cryoglobulinaemia (n = 5), thrombocytopenia (n = 1) and mononeuritis multiplex (n = 1). The median follow-up duration was 14.5 (range 2-48) months. Three patients experienced adverse events, including one mild serum sickness-like reaction with the presence of human antichimeric antibodies. Efficacy of treatment was observed in 4 of 5 patients with lymphomas and in 9 of 11 patients with systemic involvement. Dryness was improved in only a minority of patients. Corticosteroid dose was reduced in 11 patients. RTX induced decreased rheumatoid factor, gamma-globulin and beta2-microglobulin levels, and the level of B cell activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor family (BAFF) increased concomitantly with B cell depletion. Five patients were re-treated, with good efficacy and tolerance, except for one with probable serum sickness-like reaction. CONCLUSION: This study shows good efficacy and fair tolerance of RTX for systemic features. In addition, RTX allows for a marked reduction in corticosteroid use. Except for BAFF, the level of which increases, serum B cell biomarker levels decrease after taking RTX. Controlled trials should be performed to confirm the efficacy of RTX in pSS."],"offsets":[[147,1931]]}],"entities":[{"id":"62","type":"Diseases &

We examined the Wnt pathway in HCC by comparing the expression of beta-catenin target genes and the level of beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation, in 45 HCC tumors and four cell lines. Among these samples, beta-catenin and AXIN1 were mutated in 20 and seven cases, respectively. We found a significant correlation between activated beta-catenin mutations and overexpression of mRNA for the target genes glutamine synthetase (GS), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)49 and glutamate transporter (GLT)-1 (P=0.0001), but not for the genes ornithine aminotransferase, LECT2, c-myc and cyclin D1. We also showed that GS is a good immunohistochemical marker of beta-catenin activation in HCC. However, we observed no induction of GS, GPR49 or GLT-1 in the five inactivated Axin1 tumors. Beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation in two Axin1-mutated HCC cell lines was much weaker than in beta-catenin-mutated cell lines. Our results strongly suggest that in HCC, contrary to expectation, the loss of function of Axin1 is not equivalent to the gain of function of beta-catenin.

We sought to identify potential targets of IR-activated PP1. Untreated and IR-treated Jurkat cells were labeled with (32)P orthophosphate, and nuclear extracts were subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography to recover phosphatase complexes that were analyzed by 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Several proteins associated with protein phosphatases demonstrated a significant decrease in (32)P intensity following IR, and one of these was identified as HDAC1. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed complexes containing PP1 with HDAC1 and Rb in cell extracts. In response to IR, there was an ATM-dependent activation of PP1, dephosphorylation of HDAC1, dissociation of HDAC1-PP1-Rb complexes and increased HDAC1 activity.

Genes responsible for circadian rhythm are also involved in cancer-related biological pathways as potential tumor suppressors. However, no previous studies have examined associations between circadian genes and NHL risk. In this population-based case control study (n = 455 cases; 527 controls), we examined the only identified nonsynonymous polymorphism (Ala394Thr; rs2305160) in the largest circadian gene, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), in order to examine its impact on NHL risk. Our results demonstrate a robust association of the variant Thr genotypes (Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr) with reduced risk of NHL (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.85, p = 0.001), especially B-cell lymphoma (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, p <or= 0.0001). These findings provide the first molecular epidemiologic evidence supporting a role of circadian genes in lymphomagenesis, which suggests that genetic variations in circadian genes might be a novel

A reporter construct driven by the 5'-upstream region containing any haplotype consisting of the three SNPs had substantial transcriptional activity.

Despite the emerging functions attributed to both PTPs and the actin cytoskeleton in apoptosis, the involvement of PTP-PEST in apoptotic cell death remains to be established. Using several cell-based assays, we showed that PTP-PEST participates in the regulation of apoptosis. As apoptosis progressed, a pool of PTP-PEST localized to the edge of retracting lamellipodia. Expression of PTP-PEST also sensitized cells to receptor-mediated apoptosis. Concertedly, specific degradation of PTP-PEST was observed during apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibitors, immunodepletion experiments, and in vitro cleavage assays identified caspase-3 as the primary regulator of PTP-PEST processing during apoptosis. Caspase-3 specifically cleaved PTP-PEST at the (549)DSPD motif and generated fragments, some of which displayed increased catalytic activity. Moreover, caspase-3 regulated PTP-PEST interactions with paxillin, leupaxin, Shc, and PSTPIP. PTP-PEST acted as a scaffolding molecule connecting PSTPIP to additional partners: paxillin, Shc, Csk, and activation of caspase-3 correlated with the modulation of the PTP-PEST adaptor function. In addition, cleavage of PTP-PEST facilitated cellular detachment during apoptosis.

proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and function as ligand-modulated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in many important biological processes. The PPARdelta subtype has the highest expression in the brain and is postulated to play a major role in neuronal cell function; however, the precise physiological roles of this receptor remain to be elucidated. Herein, we show that the high-affinity PPARdelta agonists L-165041 [4-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)-propoxyl]phenoxy]-acetic acid] and GW501516 [2-methyl4-((4-methyl-2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1,3-triazol-5-yl)-methylsulfanyl)phenoxy acetic acid] protect against cytotoxin-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury in vitro and both ischemic brain injury and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity in vivo. In the SH-SY5Y studies, treatment with L-165041 or GW501516 significantly and concentration-dependently attenuated cell death following thapsigargin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, or staurosporine exposure, with the extent of damage correlated with the level of caspase-3 inhibition. In the transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic brain injury in rats, i.c.v. infusion of L-165041 or GW501516 significantly attenuated the ischemic brain damage measured 24 h after reperfusion. Moreover, the PPARdelta agonists also significantly attenuated MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine and related metabolite contents in mouse brain. These results demonstrate that subtype-selective PPARdelta agonists possess antiapoptotic properties in vitro, which may underlie their potential neuroprotective potential in in vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease (PD). These findings suggest that PPARdelta agonists could be useful tools for understanding the role of PPARdelta in other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as attractive therapeutic candidates for

Fas was localized in the cytoplasm in exponentially growing cells, whereas only confluent cells expressed Fas on the cell membrane. A stimulation of confluent cells by either of EGF, IGF-I or VEGF induced once a decrease in Fas expression level and its sequential recovery. Fas expression levels in confluent cells were negatively correlated with cell doubling times (r=0.757, p=0.0088). Fas remained on the cell membrane of IgM-treated cells even after the growth factor stimulation, leading to apoptosis with abnormal mitosis, whereas the same stimulation induced Fas internalization in IgG(1)-treated cells. From these results, we suggest that Fas remaining on the cell membrane amplifies to induce apoptosis. Conversely, Fas internalization may enable cancer cells to escape from apoptosis.

Recent evidence also suggests that exposure of children to Mn is associated with developmental neurotoxicity. Astrocytes are critical for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and they play active roles in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic neurotransmission. In this report, to help elucidate the molecular events underlying Mn neurotoxicity, we systematically identified the molecular targets of Mn in primary human astrocytes at a genome-wide level, by using microarray gene expression profiling and computational data analysis algorithms. We found that Mn altered the expression of diverse genes ranging from those encoding cytokines and transporters to signal transducers and transcriptional regulators. Particularly, 28 genes encoding proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines and related functions were up-regulated, whereas 15 genes encoding functions involved in DNA replication and repair and cell cycle checkpoint control were down-regulated. Consistent with the increased expression of proinflammatory factors, analysis of common regulators revealed that 16 targets known to be positively affected by the interferon-gamma signaling pathway were up-regulated by Mn(2+). In addition, 68 genes were found to be similarly up- or down-regulated by both Mn(2+) and hypoxia. These results from genomic analysis are further supported by data from real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometric and toxicological analyses. Together, these analyses show that Mn(2+) selectively affects cell cycle progression, the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes, and the expression of proinflammatory factors in primary human astrocytes.

The increase in infectivity but not transgene expression correlated to increased surface expression of coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Increased transgene expression following infection with an adenovirus expressing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) was observed only in LNCaP cells treated with depsipeptide or MS-275. Combination of TRAIL gene therapy with HDACi but not doxorubicin resulted in increased induction of apoptosis in LNCaP cells. In contrast, apoptosis was not enhanced by HDACi in normal PrEC. These results suggest that combination of HDACi with adenoviral TRAIL gene therapy may be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer that warrants further investigation."],"offsets":[[179,1829]]}],"entities":[{"id":"743","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[68,73]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"744","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["prostate cancer"],"offsets":[[96,111]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"745","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["adverse effects"],"offsets":[[126,141]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"746","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[195,201]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"747","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["adenovirus"],"offsets":[[208,218]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"748","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["met"],"offsets":[[254,257]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"749","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["prostate cancer"],"offsets":[[504,519]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"750","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["adenovirus"],"offsets":[[530,540]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"751","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["green fluorescent protein"],"offsets":[[552,577]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"752","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["GFP"],"offsets":[[579,582]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"753","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["coxsackie and adenovirus receptor"],"offsets":[[1192,1225]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"754","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["adenovirus"],"offsets":[[1206,1216]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"755","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["CAR"],"offsets":[[1227,1230]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"756","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["CAR"],"offsets":[[1227,1230]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"757","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["infection with an adenovirus"],"offsets":[[1274,1302]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"758","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand "],"offsets":[[1314,1370]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"759","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[1371,1376]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"760","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[1463,1468]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"761","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[1703,1708]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"762","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["prostate cancer"],"offsets":[[1777,1792]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"763","type":"","text":["tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand "],"offsets":[[1314,1370]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"764","type":"","text":["infection with an adenovirus"],"offsets":[[1274,1302]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"766","type":"","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[68,73]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"767","type":"","text":["prostate cancer"],"offsets":[[96,111]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"769","type":"","text":["CAR"],"offsets":[[1227,1230]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"770","type":"","text":["adenovirus"],"offsets":[[1206,1216]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"772","type":"","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[1371,1376]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"773","type":"","text":["infection with an adenovirus"],"offsets":[[1274,1302]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"775","type":"","text":["TRAIL"],"offsets":[[1703,1708]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"776","type":"","text":["prostate cancer"],"offsets":[[1777,1792]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"765","type":"PA","arg1_id":"763","arg2_id":"764","normalized":[]},{"id":"768","type":"PA","arg1_id":"766","arg2_id":"767","normalized":[]},{"id":"771","type":"PA","arg1_id":"769","arg2_id":"770","normalized":[]},{"id":"774","type":"PA","arg1_id":"772","arg2_id":"773","normalized":[]},{"id":"777","type":"PA","arg1_id":"775","arg2_id":"776","normalized":[]}]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":15,"row":{"id":"779","document_id":"779","passages":[{"id":"780","type":"title","text":["The Connectivity Map: a new tool for biomedical research."],"offsets":[[0,57]]},{"id":"781","type":"abstract","text":["The ultimate objective of biomedical research is to connect human diseases with the genes that underlie them and drugs that treat them.

METHODS: Twenty-six crow's feet areas were injected with botulinum toxin type A in 13 women with an age range of 31 to 58 years. A total of 10 units of botulinum toxin was injected per side, with two separate injections. Schirmer 1 testing was performed before and at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months after the injections in all patients. The test was repeated at 6 months and 9 months for the patients whose Schirmer test results were not back to baseline at the 4-month follow-up. Statistical significance was evaluated with paired t test analysis. RESULTS: Overall, no statistical difference was found in Schirmer test results from baseline at 1 week (p = 0.23), 1 month (p = 0.32), or 4 months (p = 0.30) after injection. Five eyes of three patients had a significant decrease in Schirmer test results from baseline at 1 week and 1 month after injection. Three eyes of 2 patients had a significant decrease in Schirmer test results at 4 months after injection. Only one patient reported dry-eye symptoms at the 4-month follow-up. Schirmer test results of two eyes of one patient remained significantly lower than baseline at 6 months follow-up, which returned to the normal range at 9 months.

These data support the concept that LRP5 variation can contribute to minor and major variation in bone structure. INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene have been shown to cause both high and low bone mass. However, it is still controversial whether LRP5 is associated with normal BMD variation. This study explored the association of LRP5 with BMD phenotypes at three clinically important skeletal sites-the spine, hip, and ultradistal radius (UD)-in two independent populations of Chinese and white ethnicities, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Chinese sample consisted of 733 unrelated subjects. The white sample was made up of 1873 subjects from 405 nuclear families. High-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole LRP5 gene were genotyped and analyzed in both samples. RESULTS: Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses showed that the haplotype structures of LRP5 between Chinese and whites were in good agreement. Association tests showed that polymorphisms in block 5 spanning intron 7 to intron 19 of LRP5 significantly associated with spine BMD variation in both samples. Particularly, the significant association of SNP rs491347 in intron 7 with spine BMD in the Chinese sample (p=0.002) was replicated in whites, even after adjusting for multiple testing (p=0.005). Its strongly associated SNP rs1784235 could cause the loss of an estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding site in LRP5, which could partially explain the above replicated association. However, we did not observe any significant replication with BMD variation at the hip and UD. After accounting for multiple testing, associations with BMD variation at these two sites were mainly found in Chinese. Sex-stratified analyses further revealed that the LRP5 associations with BMD in Chinese and whites were driven by male and female subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our work supported LRP5 genetic variants as possible susceptibility factors for osteoporosis and fractures in humans. Especially, the SNP rs491347 and its strongly associated SNPs (e.g., rs1784235) could be important to human osteoporosis phenotypes."],"offsets":[[135,2486]]}],"entities":[{"id":"860","type":"Genes &

To identify candidate genes associated with these disorders we completed fine mapping analyses (using microsatellite markers) in 152 families from the Central Valley of Costa Rica (CVCR) (376 total subjects, 151 with a history of psychosis, 97 with a history of mania). Microsatellite analyses showed evidence of association at two contiguous markers, both located at the same genetic distance and spanning approximately 11 known genes. In a corollary gene expression study, one of these genes, malic enzyme 2 (ME2), showed levels of gene expression 5.6-fold lower in anterior cingulate tissue from post-mortem bipolar brains. Subsequent analysis of individual SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with the ME2 gene revealed one SNP and one haplotype associated with the phenotype of psychosis in the CVCR sample. ME2 interacts directly with the malate shuttle system, which has been shown to be altered in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and has roles in neuronal synthesis of glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid. The present study suggests that genetic variation in or near the ME2 gene is associated with both psychotic and manic disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar

METHODS: Gingival samples were collected from eight normal healthy individuals, eight patients with periodontitis, and eight patients with cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced gingival overgrowth. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed for ET-1, ETA, and ETB. ET-1 protein was estimated from the tissues by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of ET-1 and its receptors was also examined in gingival fibroblast cells treated with CsA. RESULTS: ET-1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with CsA-induced gingival overgrowth (P <0.001) than in patients with periodontitis and the controls. ETA mRNA was expressed more than the ETB in all examined samples. In human gingival fibroblasts, ET-1 expression was increased with CsA incorporation compared to controls (P <0.001).

We studied how the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), one of the key molecules in the development of atherosclerosis, might be affected by paeonol in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Paeonol concentration-dependently inhibited the production of ICAM-1; it inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 translocation into the nucleus and the phosphorylation of inhibitory factor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha). It also blocked the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are involved in regulating ICAM-1 production by TNF-alpha. Paeonol inhibited U937 monocyte adhesion to HUVECs stimulated by TNF-alpha, suggesting that it may inhibit the binding of monocytes to endothelium by regulating the production of critical adhesion molecules by TNF-alpha. The inhibitory effect of paeonol on ICAM-1 production might be mediated by inhibiting p38, ERK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which are involved in TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 production.

sirolimus (SRL) in a kidney transplant recipient. We present a 34-year-old woman with a second renal transplantation, complicated with steroid-resistant acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction. Two years after initiating SRL, she presented complaints of progressive dyspnoea, nonproductive cough, chest pain and low-grade fever of 1 month duration. She had chronic allograft nephropathy and slight elevation of lactic dehydrogenase levels. After exclusion of common reasons of this condition, a computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and bronchoscopy was performed, revealing ground-glass opacification with polygonal shapes on CT and an opaque appearance with numerous macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage. The alveolar macrophages stained positive by Periodic acid-Schiff. Diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) was made and drug-induced toxicity was suspected. SRL was withdrawn with marked improvement in the patients' clinical and radiological status. PAP resolved within 3 months without further therapy. PAP is a very rare complication of SRL therapy with only a few cases described. Withdrawal of SRL with conversion to another immunosuppressant seems to be an appropriate procedure in this condition."],"offsets":[[72,1372]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1348","type":"Diseases &

We previously reported that microsomal inactivation kinetic parameters of diltiazem underpredicted CYP3A inactivation in hepatocytes. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of inactivation and reversible inhibition of CYP3A by diltiazem and its N-desmethyl (MA) and N,N-didesmethyl (MD) metabolites. In human liver microsomes, MA was a more potent time-dependent inactivator of CYP3A than its parent drug, with apparent k(inact) approximately 4-fold higher than that of diltiazem at a microsomal protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. MD did not inactivate CYP3A. Inactivation of CYP3A by diltiazem was dependent on microsomal protein concentration (25, 36, and 41% decrease in CYP3A activity at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml microsomal protein, respectively, incubated with 10 microM diltiazem over 20 min), whereas inactivation by MA did not seem to be protein concentration-dependent. MA and MD were reversible inhibitors of CYP3A with competitive Ki values of 2.7 and 0.2 microM, respectively. In cryopreserved hepatocytes incubated with diltiazem, time-dependent loss of CYP3A was accompanied by increased formation of MA and MD, with the MA level similar to its K(I) at higher diltiazem concentrations. In addition, the metabolites appeared to be accumulated inside the cells. In summary, time-dependent CYP3A inactivation by MA seems to be the major contributor responsible for the loss of CYP3A in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes incubated with diltiazem. These findings suggest that prediction of CYP3A loss based solely on microsomal inactivation parameters of parent drug may be

Two 6 day courses of either 200 mg itraconazole daily or placebo with at least a 4 week washout period were conducted. Thirteen volunteers took a single oral 20 mg dose of paroxetine on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of paroxetine were monitored up to 48 hours after the dosing. Compared with placebo, itraconazole treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of paroxetine by 1.3 fold (6.7 +/- 2.5 versus 9.0 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, P < 0.05) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 48 hours [AUC (0-48)] of paroxetine by 1.5 fold (137 +/- 73 versus 199 +/- 91 ng*h/mL, P < 0.01).

The simplest strategy relies on tet-operable polymerase III-promoted shRNAs and co-expression of the tetracycline regulatory protein, TetR. In this study we have combined these features into a single lentiviral vector that upon delivery to target cells allows robust induction of shRNAs, even with low levels of doxycycline; importantly, we show minimal leakiness in the absence of inducer. We have exploited the regulatory properties of our system by targeting an essential cellular gene, the nuclear RNaseIII endonuclease Drosha.

In a cohort of five patients, measurements of integrated viral load (iVL) and cell-associated viral load (cVL) in CD4(+) cells isolated by a single positive selection step were not indicative of HIV DNA levels in the circulation, and further analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In a cohort of 46 samples total cVL was quantitated in most samples, but iVL could be quantitated in only 47.8%, since in 26% iVL was undetectable and in 21.7% the results were invalid due to high levels of unintegrated HIV DNA. There was no correlation of cVL or iVL with pVL, CD4 count, or duration of successful antiretroviral treatment. Out of 26 patients with undetectable pVL, 4 patients failed therapy within the subsequent 12 months and had higher than average iVL, but this was not the case for cVL. Among nine patients with long-term undetectable pVL, no consistent decline in cVL or iVL was seen with time, and changes in cVL and iVL within a patient could be concordant or discordant. These results show that cVL and iVL can be coordinately measured in PBMC from clinical samples but do not correlate with pVL, CD4 counts, or length of suppressive antiretroviral therapy.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1), confer resistance to various anticancer agents. We previously reported that some flavonoids have BCRP-inhibitory activity. Here we show the reversal effects of an extensive panel of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. METHODS: Reversal effects of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, or MRP1-mediated drug resistance were examined in the BCRP- or MDR1-transduced human leukemia K562 cells or in the MRP1-transfected human epidermoid carcinoma KB-3-1 cells using cell growth inhibition assays. The IC(50) values were determined from the growth inhibition curves. The RI(50) values were then determined as the concentration of inhibitor that causes a twofold reduction of the IC(50) in each transfectant. The reversal of BCRP activity was tested by measuring the fluorescence of intracellular topotecan. RESULTS: The BCRP-inhibitory activity of 32 compounds was screened, and 20 were found to be active. Among these active compounds, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone showed the strongest anti-BCRP activity with RI(50) values of 0.012 microM for SN-38 and 0.044 muM for mitoxantrone. We next examined the effects of a panel of 11 compounds on P-gp- and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. Two of the flavones, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone and acacetin, showed only low anti-P-gp activity, with the remainder displaying no suppressive effects against P-gp. None of the flavonoids that we tested inhibited MRP1. CONCLUSION: Our present results thus indicate that many flavonoids selectively inhibit BCRP only. Moreover, we examined the structure-BCRP inhibitory activity relationship from our current study."],"offsets":[[139,1922]]}],"entities":[{"id":"1735","type":"Chemicals &

METHODS: Analysis of the response rate, toxicity, quality of life, median survival and 1-year survival rates after 1-3 six-week cycles of docetaxel 30mg/m(2) weekly. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled and 42 were assessable. Five patients (10%, [3.7-22.6]) had objective responses, 14 (28%, [16.9-41.6]) had stable disease, and 23 (46%, [32.6-52.8]) progressed. The main grade 3-4 toxicity was fatigue (30%). Quality of life remained stable during treatment. The median survival time was 4.3 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 21.8%.

mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the effect on cell proliferation has extensively been investigated. A recent study showed that LPA-mediated proliferation of colon cancer cells requires activation of beta-catenin. However, the majority of colon cancer cells have deregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. This prompted us to hypothesize the presence of additional pathway(s) activated by LPA resulting in an increase in the proliferation of colon cancer cells. KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcriptional factor highly expressed in the crypt compartment of the intestinal epithelium. In this work, we investigated a role of KLF5 in LPA-mediated proliferation. We show that LPA stimulated the expression levels of KLF5 mRNA and protein in colon cancer cells and this stimulation was mediated by LPA(2) and LPA(3). Silencing of KLF5 expression by small interfering RNA significantly attenuated LPA-mediated proliferation of SW480 and HCT116 cells. LPA-mediated KLF5 induction was partially blocked by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and protein kinase C-delta. Moreover, we observed that LPA regulates KLF5 expression via eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k). Inhibition of calmodulin or silencing of eEF2k blocked the stimulation in KLF5 expression. Knockdown of eEF2k specifically inhibited KLF5 induction by LPA but not by fetal bovine serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results identify KLF5 as a target of LPA-mediated signaling and suggest a role of KLF5 in promoting proliferation of intestinal epithelia in response to LPA."],"offsets":[[111,1743]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2039","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["Lysophosphatidic acid"],"offsets":[[0,21]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2040","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["colon cancer"],"offsets":[[51,63]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2041","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["KrÃ¼ppel-like factor "],"offsets":[[87,108]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2042","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" lysophosphatidic aci"],"offsets":[[158,179]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2043","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["(LP"],"offsets":[[181,184]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2044","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" LP"],"offsets":[[282,285]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2045","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":[" colon cance"],"offsets":[[312,324]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2046","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" beta-cateni"],"offsets":[[354,366]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2047","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":[" colon cance"],"offsets":[[393,405]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2048","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" Wn"],"offsets":[[437,440]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2049","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["/beta-cateni"],"offsets":[[441,453]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2050","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" LP"],"offsets":[[546,549]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2051","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":[" colon cance"],"offsets":[[599,611]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2052","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" KrÃ¼ppel-like factor"],"offsets":[[619,640]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2053","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":[" (KL"],"offsets":[[642,646]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2054","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["f KL"],"offsets":[[788,792]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2055","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["n L"],"offsets":[[796,799]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2056","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["t L"],"offsets":[[837,840]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2057","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["f KL"],"offsets":[[877,881]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2058","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["n colon canc"],"offsets":[[902,914]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2059","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["y LPA("],"offsets":[[958,964]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2060","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["d LPA("],"offsets":[[969,975]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2061","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":[".

Recently, mutations have been identified in the ALDH7A1 gene in Caucasian families with PDS. To elucidate further the genetic background of PDS, we screened for ALDH7A1 mutations in five PDS families (patients 1-5) that included four Orientals. Diagnosis as having PDS was confirmed by pyridoxine-withdrawal test. Exon sequencing analysis of patients 1-4 revealed eight ALDH7A1 mutations in compound heterozygous forms: five missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, one point mutation at the splicing donor site in intron 1, and a 1937-bp genomic deletion. The deletion included the entire exon 17, which was flanked by two Alu elements in introns 16 and 17. None of the mutations was found in 100 control chromosomes. In patient 5, no mutation was found by the exon sequencing analysis. Furthermore, expression level or nucleotide sequences of ALDH7A1 mRNA in lymphoblasts were normal. Plasma pipecolic acid concentration was not elevated in patient 5. These observations suggest that ALDH7A1 mutation is unlikely to be responsible for patient 5. Abnormal metabolism of GABA/glutamate in brain has long been suggested as the underlying pathophysiology of PDS. CSF glutamate concentration was elevated during the off-pyridoxine period in patient 3, but not in patient 2 or 5.

associates with HDL-apolipoprotein A-I (HDL-apoA-I) and thereby plays a role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Current sera tests make use of promiscuous substrates and provide no indications regarding HDL-PON1 complex formation. We developed new enzymatic tests that detect total PON1 levels, irrespective of HDL status and R/Q polymorphism, as well as the degree of catalytic stimulation and increased stability that follow PON1's tight binding to HDL-apoA-I. The tests are based on measuring total PON1 levels with a fluorogenic phosphotriester, measuring the lipolactonase activity with a chromogenic lactone, and assaying the enzyme's chelator-mediated inactivation rate. The latter two are affected by tight HDL binding and thereby derive the levels of the serum PON1-HDL complex. We demonstrate these new tests with a group of healthy individuals (n=54) and show that the levels of PON1-HDL vary by a factor of 12. Whereas the traditionally applied paraoxonase and arylesterase tests weakly reflect PON1-HDL levels (R=0.64), the lipolactonase test provides better correlation (R=0.80). These new tests indicate the levels and activity of PON1 in a physiologically relevant context as well as the levels and quality of the HDL particles with which the enzyme is associated."],"offsets":[[93,1425]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2261","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL"],"offsets":[[40,43]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2262","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["serum PON1"],"offsets":[[50,60]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2263","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["lipolactonase"],"offsets":[[69,82]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2264","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["Serum paraoxonase"],"offsets":[[93,110]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2265","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[112,116]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2266","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["lipolactonase"],"offsets":[[123,136]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2267","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL-apolipoprotein A-I"],"offsets":[[158,180]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2268","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL-apoA-I"],"offsets":[[182,192]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2269","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL-PON1"],"offsets":[[348,356]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2270","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[427,431]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2271","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL"],"offsets":[[456,459]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2272","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["R/Q polymorphism"],"offsets":[[471,487]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2273","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[572,576]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2274","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL-apoA-I"],"offsets":[[596,606]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2275","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[647,651]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2276","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["fluorogenic phosphotriester"],"offsets":[[666,693]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2277","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["lipolactonase"],"offsets":[[709,722]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2278","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["chromogenic lactone"],"offsets":[[739,758]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2279","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL"],"offsets":[[860,863]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2280","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1-HDL"],"offsets":[[915,923]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2281","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1-HDL"],"offsets":[[1035,1043]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2282","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["paraoxonase"],"offsets":[[1102,1113]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2283","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["arylesterase"],"offsets":[[1118,1130]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2284","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1-HDL"],"offsets":[[1152,1160]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2285","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["lipolactonase"],"offsets":[[1182,1195]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2286","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[1291,1295]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2287","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["HDL"],"offsets":[[1375,1378]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2288","type":"","text":["fluorogenic phosphotriester"],"offsets":[[666,693]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2289","type":"","text":["PON1"],"offsets":[[647,651]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2291","type":"","text":["chromogenic lactone"],"offsets":[[739,758]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2292","type":"","text":["lipolactonase"],"offsets":[[709,722]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"2290","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2288","arg2_id":"2289","normalized":[]},{"id":"2293","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2291","arg2_id":"2292","normalized":[]}]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":41,"row":{"id":"2295","document_id":"2295","passages":[{"id":"2296","type":"title","text":["A cytosolic splice variant of Cab45 interacts with Munc18b and impacts on amylase secretion by pancreatic acini."],"offsets":[[0,112]]},{"id":"2297","type":"abstract","text":["We identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein Cab45 as an interaction partner of Munc18b. Although the full-length Cab45 resides in Golgi lumen, we characterize a cytosolic splice variant, Cab45b, expressed in pancreatic acini. Cab45b is shown to bind (45)Ca(2+), and, of its three EF-hand motifs, EF-hand 2 is demonstrated to be crucial for the ion binding. Cab45b is shown to interact with Munc18b in an in vitro assay, and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of Ca(2+). In this assay, Cab45b also binds the Munc18a isoform in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The endogenous Cab45b in rat acini coimmunoprecipitates with Munc18b, syntaxin 2, and syntaxin 3, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors with key roles in the Ca(2+)-triggered zymogen secretion. Furthermore, we show that Munc18b bound to syntaxin 3 recruits Cab45b onto the plasma membrane. Importantly, antibodies against Cab45b are shown to inhibit in a specific and dose-dependent manner the Ca(2+)-induced amylase release from streptolysin-O-permeabilized acini.

METHOD: A high-risk birth cohort was formed by searching the Finnish Perinatal Register for all births from 1991-2000 with arterial cord pH values below 7.20, an indication of fetal asphyxia. This database was merged with national hospital discharge registries to determine psychiatric morbidity of the mothers and the mothers' first-degree relatives. Mothers were divided into 3 groups: women diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (n=53), mothers with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (n=590) and healthy controls (n=36,895). RESULT: Schizophrenic women had significantly more OCs than mothers with a first-degree schizophrenic relative and controls. These women had significantly increased rates of eclampsia, premature delivery, prenatal hospitalizations, and marginally significant increases in high blood pressure. Offspring of schizophrenic mothers had significantly decreased APGAR scores and birth weight and increased medical complications after birth. In contrast, women with a schizophrenic first-degree relative had no significant increases in OCs compared to controls. Schizophrenic mothers also smoked more than the other groups and smoking was found to mediate the relationship between maternal schizophrenic status and decreased birth weight among offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal schizophrenia during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of OCs, possibly due to engagement in health-risk behaviors during pregnancy, such as smoking, whereas genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, by itself, does not appear to be related to incidence of OCs."],"offsets":[[117,1963]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2448","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[37,50]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2449","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["obstetric complications"],"offsets":[[92,115]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2450","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[196,209]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2451","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[245,258]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2452","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["obstetric complications"],"offsets":[[321,344]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2453","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["OCs"],"offsets":[[346,349]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2454","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["fetal asphyxia"],"offsets":[[528,542]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2455","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[761,774]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2456","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizoaffective disorder"],"offsets":[[775,799]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2457","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[850,863]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2458","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizoaffective disorder"],"offsets":[[864,888]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2459","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["Schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[938,951]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2460","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["OCs"],"offsets":[[981,984]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2461","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[1018,1031]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2462","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["eclampsia"],"offsets":[[1104,1113]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2463","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["premature delivery"],"offsets":[[1115,1133]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2464","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["prenatal hospitalizations"],"offsets":[[1135,1160]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2465","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["high blood pressure"],"offsets":[[1202,1221]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2466","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[1236,1249]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2467","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["medical complications"],"offsets":[[1330,1351]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2468","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[1391,1404]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2469","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["OCs"],"offsets":[[1459,1462]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2470","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["Schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[1485,1498]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2471","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenic"],"offsets":[[1613,1626]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2472","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[1700,1713]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2473","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["OCs"],"offsets":[[1761,1764]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2474","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[1887,1900]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2475","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["OCs"],"offsets":[[1959,1962]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":44,"row":{"id":"2477","document_id":"2477","passages":[{"id":"2478","type":"title","text":["Quantification of circulating varicella-zoster virus DNA for follow-up in a case of visceral varicella-zoster infection ameliorated with intravenous acyclovir."],"offsets":[[0,159]]},{"id":"2479","type":"abstract","text":["We describe a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who developed visceral varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection following cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT) and was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir (ACV).

related to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and events. One mechanism could be that tobacco smoke acts on the cardiovascular system by altering the autonomic function and/or inducing inflammatory responses. We used data from 3 744 men aged 67-77 years from the city of Oslo that participated in the health screening for the Oslo II Health Study in 2000, to explore associations between C-reactive protein and environmental exposures including exposure to tobacco smoke products. Levels of C-reactive protein were higher in current smokers (2.05 mg/l, IQR, 1.11-4.17 mg/l), compared to former-smokers (1.58 mg/l, IQR, 0.83-3.03 mg/l) and non-smokers (1.26 mg/l, IQR, 0.65-2.40 mg/l).

outcomes and the tolerability of ziprasidone in relation to its plasma levels. METHODS: Thirteen inpatients affected by schizophrenia were included in the study after an acute exacerbation phase. Ziprasidone monotherapy was administered for a period of eight weeks at a mean dose of 123.07+/-30.38 mg/day. Plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Nine patients completed the study. A significant clinical improvement was observed, especially in negative symptoms ( P<0.05), and there was a significant improvement in extrapyramidal symptoms ( P<0.01). Clinical laboratory tests, such as ECG and weight, did not significantly change from baseline. Plasma ziprasidone levels ranged from 20 ng/mL to 160 ng/mL (mean: 75.8 ng/mL) and were significantly related to the improvement in negative symptoms. DISCUSSION: The study showed that ziprasidone was effective and tolerable, that use of ziprasidone was characterized by an absence of extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain, and that no alterations in clinical laboratory tests occurred. The findings suggest a relationship between plasma levels and the clinical response to negative symptoms of schizophrenia."],"offsets":[[90,1356]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2791","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["Ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[0,11]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2792","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[184,195]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2793","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[271,284]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2794","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["Ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[347,358]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2795","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["negative symptoms"],"offsets":[[643,660]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2796","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["extrapyramidal symptoms"],"offsets":[[715,738]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2797","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["weight"],"offsets":[[793,799]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2798","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[852,863]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2799","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["negative symptoms"],"offsets":[[977,994]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2800","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[1030,1041]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2801","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[1083,1094]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2802","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["absence"],"offsets":[[1119,1126]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2803","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["extrapyramidal symptoms"],"offsets":[[1130,1153]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2804","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["weight gain"],"offsets":[[1158,1169]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2805","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["negative symptoms of schizophrenia"],"offsets":[[1321,1355]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2806","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["symptoms"],"offsets":[[1330,1338]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2807","type":"","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[852,863]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2808","type":"","text":["negative symptoms"],"offsets":[[977,994]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2810","type":"","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[1083,1094]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2811","type":"","text":["extrapyramidal symptoms"],"offsets":[[1130,1153]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2813","type":"","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[1083,1094]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2814","type":"","text":["extrapyramidal symptoms"],"offsets":[[1130,1153]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2816","type":"","text":["ziprasidone"],"offsets":[[1083,1094]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2817","type":"","text":["weight gain"],"offsets":[[1158,1169]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"2809","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2807","arg2_id":"2808","normalized":[]},{"id":"2812","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2810","arg2_id":"2811","normalized":[]},{"id":"2815","type":"NA","arg1_id":"2813","arg2_id":"2814","normalized":[]},{"id":"2818","type":"NA","arg1_id":"2816","arg2_id":"2817","normalized":[]}]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":53,"row":{"id":"2820","document_id":"2820","passages":[{"id":"2821","type":"title","text":["Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists in the management of hypertension."],"offsets":[[0,78]]},{"id":"2822","type":"abstract","text":["Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have been maligned in recent years because of concerns regarding their cardiovascular and overall safety profile. Specifically, it was widely publicised in the mid-1990s that these agents might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding and cancer. Data linking these agents with increased cardiovascular risk were based on nonrandomised studies and implicated short-acting, immediate-release agents. These results were inappropriately extrapolated to longer-acting compounds, extended-release products, and to the non-dihydropyridine class. Fortunately, recent studies have vindicated the class from safety allegations. These studies are reviewed herein. Compared with both diuretics and contemporary agents, amlodipine decreases cardiovascular events to a similar or greater extent without evidence for increased coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal bleeding or cancer. Despite these data, initial concerns have had lasting repercussions, as the use of dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists appears to lag behind what emerging data would support. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists have several noteworthy attributes that merit consideration in the management of hypertension. The blood pressure response to this class of drugs is less contingent on patient factors such as age and race compared with other antihypertensive agents (e.g. ACE inhibitors). Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may exert effects that protect against stroke that are independent of their blood pressure-lowering mechanism. Unlike diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor anatagonists (beta-blockers), dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are lipid neutral and do not disturb glucose homeostasis. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists demonstrate a highly desirable profile when administered as part of combination therapy. Combinations of dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists display additive efficacy and an enviable adverse-effect profile. Collectively, the cardiovascular benefit, metabolic neutrality and homogeneous blood pressure response illuminated in recent studies, and reviewed here, represent a reaffirmation of the benefit of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and should serve to help reinforce the critical importance of these agents in the therapeutic armamentarium against cardiovascular disease."],"offsets":[[79,2557]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2823","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["Dihydropyridine calcium channel

constitute an essential family of pattern recognition molecules that, through direct recognition of conserved microbial components, initiate inflammatory responses following infection. In this role, TLR1 enables host responses to a variety of bacteria, including pathogenic species of mycobacteria. In this study, we report that I602S, a common single nucleotide polymorphism within TLR1, is associated with aberrant trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface and diminished responses of blood monocytes to bacterial agonists. When expressed in heterologous systems, the TLR1 602S variant, but not the TLR1 602I variant, exhibits the expected deficiencies in trafficking and responsiveness. Among white Europeans, the 602S allele represents the most common single nucleotide polymorphism affecting TLR function identified to date. Surprisingly, the 602S allele is associated with a decreased incidence of leprosy, suggesting that Mycobacterium leprae subverts the TLR system as a mechanism of immune evasion."],"offsets":[[132,1150]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2899","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[97,101]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2900","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["leprosy"],"offsets":[[123,130]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2901","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLRs"],"offsets":[[132,136]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2902","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["inflammatory responses"],"offsets":[[278,300]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2903","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["infection"],"offsets":[[311,320]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2904","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[336,340]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2905","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["mycobacteria"],"offsets":[[422,434]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2906","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["I602S"],"offsets":[[466,471]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2907","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[520,524]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2908","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[713,717]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2909","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["602S"],"offsets":[[718,722]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2910","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["TLR1 602I"],"offsets":[[744,753]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2911","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR1 602I"],"offsets":[[744,753]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2912","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["deficiencies"],"offsets":[[785,797]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2913","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["602S"],"offsets":[[860,864]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2914","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR"],"offsets":[[940,943]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2915","type":"SNP & Sequence variations","text":["602S"],"offsets":[[991,995]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2916","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["leprosy"],"offsets":[[1047,1054]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2917","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["Mycobacterium leprae"],"offsets":[[1072,1092]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2918","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["TLR"],"offsets":[[1106,1109]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2919","type":"","text":["602S"],"offsets":[[991,995]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2920","type":"","text":["leprosy"],"offsets":[[1047,1054]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2922","type":"","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[97,101]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2923","type":"","text":["leprosy"],"offsets":[[123,130]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2925","type":"","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[336,340]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2926","type":"","text":["mycobacteria"],"offsets":[[422,434]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2928","type":"","text":["TLR1"],"offsets":[[713,717]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2929","type":"","text":["deficiencies"],"offsets":[[785,797]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2931","type":"","text":["TLR"],"offsets":[[1106,1109]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2932","type":"","text":["leprosy"],"offsets":[[1047,1054]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2934","type":"","text":["602S"],"offsets":[[991,995]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2935","type":"","text":["Mycobacterium leprae"],"offsets":[[1072,1092]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2937","type":"","text":["TLR"],"offsets":[[1106,1109]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"2938","type":"","text":["Mycobacterium leprae"],"offsets":[[1072,1092]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"2921","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2919","arg2_id":"2920","normalized":[]},{"id":"2924","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2922","arg2_id":"2923","normalized":[]},{"id":"2927","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2925","arg2_id":"2926","normalized":[]},{"id":"2930","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2928","arg2_id":"2929","normalized":[]},{"id":"2933","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2931","arg2_id":"2932","normalized":[]},{"id":"2936","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2934","arg2_id":"2935","normalized":[]},{"id":"2939","type":"PA","arg1_id":"2937","arg2_id":"2938","normalized":[]}]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":55,"row":{"id":"2941","document_id":"2941","passages":[{"id":"2942","type":"title","text":["Community-based trial of R-CHOP and maintenance rituximab for intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma with first-cycle filgrastim for older patients."],"offsets":[[0,158]]},{"id":"2943","type":"abstract","text":["BACKGROUND: Administration of full-dose R-CHOP (rituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) chemotherapy is important to maximize response in patients with intermediate-or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma but might be difficult in older patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This community-based study was conducted to determine response, toxicity, and disease-free survival in patients with intermediate-or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving R-CHOP with filgrastim. Patients received 6-8 cycles of R-CHOP followed by 4 cycles of maintenance rituximab for responders. Patients aged > 60 years or with increased infection risk received filgrastim 5 microg/kg per day in all R-CHOP cycles; other patients received filgrastim after a neutropenic event (no planned administration for cycle 1). RESULTS: Of 101 patients enrolled, 60 (59%) were aged > 60 years and received filgrastim in all cycles. Thirty-three patients aged <or= 60 years (80%) received filgrastim, 7 (17%) as primary use in cycle 1. Chemotherapy average relative dose intensity was comparable between age groups (91% > 60 years vs. 93% <or= 60 years). Overall response was similar in both groups (87% > 60 years vs. 95% <or= 60 years; P=0.19); however, the complete response rate was significantly lower for older patients (42% > 60 years vs. 71% <or= 60 years; P=0.005). Seventy-six percent of patients (75% > 60 years vs. 78% <or= 60 years) had no evidence of progression after 2 years of follow-up. Febrile neutropenia (fever >or= 38.3 degrees C with absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm) occurred in 17% of patients overall (22% > 60 years vs. 10% <or= 60 years), and 8% had cycle-1 events (12% > 60 years vs. 2% <or= 60 years). CONCLUSION: Patients aged > 60 years receiving R-CHOP with filgrastim support in all cycles received comparable doses of chemotherapy and had similar overall response rates compared wtih those of younger patients receiving no preemptive cycle-1 filgrastim."],"offsets":[[159,2129]]}],"entities":[{"id":"2944","type":"Chemicals &

genes. In developed countries, 1 in 1,000 children is born with deafness severe enough to require special education services, and about 60% of the cases of isolated deafness have a genetic origin. Although more than 100 genes for hearing loss are known currently, only a few are routinely tested in the clinical practice. In this study, we present our findings from the molecular diagnostic screening of the GJB2 and GJB3 genes, del(GJB6-D13S1,830) and del(GJB6-D13S1,854) deletions in the GJB6 gene, Q829X mutation in the otoferlin gene (OTOF) and, the A1,555G and A7,445G mutations in the mitochondrial genome over an 8-year period. Mutations analysis in the previously mentioned genes and mutations was performed on 645 unrelated Brazilian patients with hearing loss who fell into two different testing groups. Different mutations in the GJB2 gene were responsible for most of cases studied, but deletions in the GJB6 gene as well as mitochondrial mutations were also found. While most cases of hearing loss in this country are due to environmental factors, the genetic etiology of deafness will increasingly be determined as more genetic tests become available.CI - (c) 2007

Anti-Abeta antibodies can reverse the histologic and cognitive impairments in mice which overexpress Abeta. Passive immunization appears safer than vaccination and treatment of patients will likely require human rather than xenogenic antibodies. Effective treatment will likely require antibody to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, antibodies typically cross the BBB very poorly and accumulate less well in brain than even albumin, a substance nearly totally excluded from the brain. We compared the ability of two anti-Abeta human monoclonal IgM antibodies, L11.3 and HyL5, to cross the BBB of young CD-1 mice to that of young and aged SAMP8 mice. The SAMP8 mouse has a spontaneous mutation that induces an age-related, Abeta-dependent cognitive deficit. There was preferential uptake of intravenously administered L11.3 in comparison to HyL5, albumin, and a control human monoclonal IgM (RF), especially by hippocampus and olfactory bulb in aged SAMP8 mice. Injection of L11.3 into the brains of aged SAMP8 mice reversed both learning and memory impairments in aged SAMP8 mice, whereas IgG and IgM controls were ineffective. Pharmacokinetic analysis predicted that an intravenous dose 1000 times higher than the brain injection dose would reverse cognitive impairments. This predicted intravenous dose reversed the impairment in learning, but not memory, in aged SAMP8 mice. In conclusion, an IgM antibody was produced that crosses the BBB to reverse cognitive impairment in a murine model of Alzheimer's

In rodent models, melanocortin agonists including the nonselective peptide MTII have been shown to decrease food intake and body weight while antagonists such as SHU9119 and AGRP have been shown to stimulate food intake and increase body weight. Deletion of either the MC3R or MC4R in mice was found to be associated with obesity although hyperphagia was only observed in the MC4R deficient mice. Similarly in humans, inactivating mutations of the MC4R have been found in as many as six percent of obese individuals. The suggestion from these findings that activation of MC4Rs would have an anorectic effect in humans has resulted in efforts to produce selective agonists for the treatment of obesity. Over the past decade, efforts to develop MC4R selective small molecule and peptide agonists have been met with fractional success. Many small molecule agonists have been identified; however, few have been shown to have activity in vivo. While their use as therapeutics may have limitations, selective and potent peptide agonists have been shown by several investigators to decrease food intake and body weight in rodent models.

METHODS: Genomic DNA from 134 Crohn' s disease (CD), 111 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 248 control subjects was isolated from resected intestinal tissue or blood. Allelic composition at SNP loci was determined by PCR-RFLP or tetra primer ARMS PCR. RESULTS: The TIMP-1 genotype TT in women and T in men at SNP +372 T/C was found to increase CD susceptibility (39% vs 23.8%, P = 0.018 and 67.9% vs 51.6%, P = 0.055, respectively), while women with this genotype were less prone to development of fistulae during follow-up (41.4% vs 68.3%, P = 0.025). Male IBD or CD patients carrying the TIMP-1 +372 T-allele expressed lower levels of TIMP-1 in surgically resected macroscopically inflamed tissue (0.065 < P < 0.01). The 5T5T genotype at MMP-3 SNP -1613 5T/6T increased the chance of stenotic complications in CD during follow-up (91.2% vs 71.8%, P = 0.022) but seemed to protect against colonic involvement of this disease at first endoscopic/radiologic examination (35.3% vs 59.5%, P = 0.017).

These regulatory elements are involved in the control of nuclear transport, polyadenylation status, subcellular targetting as well as rates of translation and degradation of mRNA. Indeed, 3'-UTR mutations have been associated with disease, but frequently this region is not analyzed. To gain insights into congenital heart disease (CHD), we have been analyzing cardiac-specific transcription factor genes, including GATA4, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor. Germline mutations in the coding region of GATA4 have been associated with septation defects of the human heart, but mutations are rather rare. Previously, we identified 19 somatically-derived zinc finger mutations in diseased tissues of malformed hearts. We now continued our search in the 609 bp 3'-UTR region of GATA4 to explore further molecular avenues leading to CHD. METHODS: By direct sequencing, we analyzed the 3'-UTR of GATA4 in DNA isolated from 68 formalin-fixed explanted hearts with complex cardiac malformations encompassing ventricular, atrial, and atrioventricular septal defects. We also analyzed blood samples of 12 patients with CHD and 100 unrelated healthy individuals. RESULTS: We identified germline and somatic mutations in the 3'-UTR of GATA4. In the malformed hearts, we found nine frequently occurring sequence alterations and six dbSNPs in the 3'-UTR region of GATA4. Seven of these mutations are predicted to affect RNA folding. We also found further five nonsynonymous mutations in exons 6 and 7 of GATA4. Except for the dbSNPs, analysis of tissue distal to the septation defect failed to detect sequence variations in the same donor, thus suggesting somatic origin and mosaicism of mutations. In a family, we observed c.+119A > T in the 3'-UTR associated with ASD type II. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that somatic GATA4 mutations in the 3'-UTR may provide an additional molecular rationale for CHD."],"offsets":[[107,2165]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3461","type":"SNP &

Treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induces CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels and also activates inhibitory AhR-ERalpha crosstalk associated with hormone-induced reporter gene expression. In ZR-75 cells grown under hypoxia, induction of these AhR-mediated responses by TCDD was significantly inhibited. This was not accompanied by decreased nuclear AhR levels or decreased interaction of the AhR complex with the CYP1A1 gene promoter as determined in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Hypoxia-induced loss of Ah-responsiveness was not associated with induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha or other factors that sequester the AhR nuclear translocation (Arnt) protein, and overexpression of Arnt under hypoxia did not restore Ah-responsiveness. The p65 subunit of NFkappaB which inhibits AhR-mediated transactivation was not induced by hypoxia and was primarily cytosolic in ZR-75 cells grown under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. In ZR-75 cells maintained under hypoxic conditions for 24 h, BRCA1 (an enhancer of AhR-mediated transactivation in breast cancer cells) was significantly decreased and this contributed to loss of Ah-responsiveness. In cells grown under hypoxia for 6 h, BRCA1 was not decreased, but induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD was significantly decreased. Cotreatment of ZR-75 cells with TCDD plus the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 6 h enhanced CYP1A1 expression in cells grown under hypoxia and normoxia. These results suggest that hypoxia rapidly induces protein(s) that inhibit Ah-responsiveness and these may be similar to constitutively expressed inhibitors of Ah-responsiveness (under normoxia) that

A common MTHFR polymorphism (C677T) leads to a variant with reduced activity and associated with increased Hcy levels. Coronary surgery precipitates a significant and sustained increase in the blood concentrations of Hcy and elevated levels of plasma Hcy have been associated to saphenous vein (SV) graft disease after CABG. However, the effects of MTHFR genotypes in the incidence of cardiovascular events after CABG have not been investigated prospectively. Here, we investigate whether MTHFR gene variants are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk in individuals submitted to CABG. We also propose a molecular mechanism to explain our findings. METHODS: We performed MTHFR C677T genotypes in 558 patients with two or three vessel-disease and normal left ventricular function prospectively followed in the MASS II Trial, a randomized study to compare treatments for multivessel CAD and preserved left ventricle function. Follow-up time was 5 years. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and evaluated with the log-rank statistic. We assessed the relationship between baseline variables and the composite end-point of death, myocardial infarction and refractory angina using a Cox proportional hazards survival model. Finally, using an ex-vivo organ culture we have reproduced the arterialization of SV implants by culturing human SV either under venous hemodynamic condition (flow: 5 mL/min; no pressure) or arterial hemodynamic condition (flow: 50 mL/min; pressure: 80 mm Hg) for 1 day. MTHFR gene expression was quantified by real time RT-PCR in 15 SV from different individuals in both experimental conditions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among individuals within each genotype group for baseline clinical characteristics. A statistically significant association between the TT genotype, associated with increased serum levels of Hcy, and cardiovascular mortality after 5 years was verified (p=0.007) in individuals submitted to CABG surgery. In addition, MTHFR TT genotype was still significantly associated with a 4.4 fold increased risk in cardiovascular outcomes (p=0.01) even after adjustment of a Cox multivariate model for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and number of diseased vessels in this population. Finally, a significant reduction in MTHFR gene expression was demonstrated in human SV when submitted to an arterial hemodynamic condition (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There is a dynamic regulation of MTHFR gene expression during the arterialization process of human saphenous vein grafts resulting in lower levels of gene expression when in an arterial hemodynamic condition. In addition, the C677T MTHFR functional variant is associated with a worse outcome in individuals submitted to CABG. Taken together, these data suggest an important role of Hcy metabolism in individuals after CABG."],"offsets":[[143,3141]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3728","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["mortality"],"offsets":[[72,81]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3729","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["coronary artery disease"],"offsets":[[85,108]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3730","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cardiovascular disease"],"offsets":[[233,255]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3731","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["reduced activity"],"offsets":[[317,333]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3732","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["SV) graft disease"],"offsets":[[552,569]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3733","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cardiovascular events"],"offsets":[[642,663]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3734","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cardiovascular"],"offsets":[[799,813]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3735","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["multivessel CAD"],"offsets":[[1136,1151]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3736","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["death"],"offsets":[[1411,1416]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3737","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["myocardial infarction"],"offsets":[[1418,1439]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3738","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["refractory angina"],"offsets":[[1444,1461]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3739","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cardiovascular"],"offsets":[[2155,2169]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3740","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["mortality"],"offsets":[[2170,2179]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3741","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["still"],"offsets":[[2294,2299]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3742","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cardiovascular"],"offsets":[[2359,2373]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3743","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["hypertension"],"offsets":[[2456,2468]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"3744","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["diabetes"],"offsets":[[2470,2478]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":65,"row":{"id":"3746","document_id":"3746","passages":[{"id":"3747","type":"title","text":["Association of variants of the interleukin-23 receptor gene with susceptibility to pediatric Crohn's disease."],"offsets":[[0,109]]},{"id":"3748","type":"abstract","text":["BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recently an association was shown between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11209026, within the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) locus and Crohn's disease (CD) as a consequence of a genome-wide association study of this disease in adults. We examined the effects of this and other previously reported SNPs at this locus with respect to CD in children. METHODS: By using data from our ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 142 pediatric CD patients and 281 matched controls, we investigated the association of the previously reported SNPs at the IL23R locus with the childhood form of this disease. RESULTS: By using the Fisher exact test, the minor allele frequency of rs11209026 in the patients was 1.75%, whereas it was 6.61% in the controls, yielding a protective odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.65; 1-sided P = 9.2 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, of all the SNPs previously reported, rs11209026 was associated the most strongly. A subsequent family based association test (which is more resistant to population stratification) with 65 sets of trios derived from our initial patient cohort yielded significant association with rs11209026 in a transmission disequilibrium test (1-sided P = .0017). In contrast, no association was detected to the caspase-recruitment domain 15 gene for the inflammatory bowel disease phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The OR of the IL23R variant in our pediatric study is highly comparable with that reported previously in a non-Jewish adult inflammatory bowel disease case-control cohort (OR, 0.26). As such, variants in the IL23R gene confer a similar magnitude of risk of CD to children as for their adult counterparts."],"offsets":[[110,1819]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3749","type":"Genes & Molecular

It has good oral exposure and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice. Because bolus administration of the compound results in large differences in C(max) and C(trough), we investigated the effect of continuous infusion of a VEGFR inhibitor on tumor growth and angiogenesis. GW771806, which has similar enzyme and cellular profiles to GW786034, was used for these studies due to higher solubility requirements for infusion studies. Comparing the pharmacokinetics by two different routes of administration (bolus p.o. dosing and continuous infusion), we showed that the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of VEGFR inhibitors is dependent on steady-state concentration of the compound above a threshold. The steady-state concentration required for these effects is consistent with the concentration required for the inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs.

It was determined that the reason why 491 of 20 817 persons (2.4%) applied during this term was because of poisoning: 159 (32.4%) of such patients were male and 332 of them (67.6%) were female. It was found that the average age of men was 27.1 +/- 10.5 years and that of women was 24.4 +/- 9.5 years (P = 0.005); 427 of poisoning cases (87.0%) happened intentionally as suicide attempts and 64 of them (13.0%) were accidental. The rate of suicide-purposed poisoning was higher in women and the rate of unintentional poisoning was higher in men (P +/- 0.001). The drugs were accountable for 71.1% of all poisoning cases and the pesticides were accountable for 18.9% of such cases. Poisonings increase during summers. The mortality rate in poisonings was found as 0.8%. The drugs and pesticides in Ckurova region constitute 90.0% of all poisoning cases.

To provide decisive evidence for such an involvement and determine its mechanisms were the aims of the present study. We synthesized a new TRPV1 antagonist, AMG0347 [(E)-N-(7-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-3-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], and characterized it in vitro. We then found that this drug is the most potent TRPV1 antagonist known to increase T(b) of rats and mice and showed (by using knock-out mice) that the entire hyperthermic effect of AMG0347 is TRPV1 dependent. AMG0347-induced hyperthermia was brought about by one or both of the two major autonomic cold-defense effector mechanisms (tail-skin vasoconstriction and/or thermogenesis), but it did not involve warmth-seeking behavior. The magnitude of the hyperthermic response depended on neither T(b) nor tail-skin temperature at the time of AMG0347 administration, thus indicating that AMG0347-induced hyperthermia results from blockade of tonic TRPV1 activation by nonthermal factors. AMG0347 was no more effective in causing hyperthermia when administered into the brain (intracerebroventricularly) or spinal cord (intrathecally) than when given systemically (intravenously), which indicates a peripheral site of action. We then established that localized intra-abdominal desensitization of TRPV1 channels with intraperitoneal resiniferatoxin blocks the T(b) response to systemic AMG0347; the extent of desensitization was determined by using a comprehensive battery of functional tests. We conclude that tonic activation of TRPV1 channels in the abdominal viscera by yet unidentified nonthermal factors inhibits skin vasoconstriction and thermogenesis, thus having a suppressive effect on T(b)."],"offsets":[[149,2020]]}],"entities":[{"id":"3917","type":"Genes & Molecular Sequences","text":["transient receptor potential vanilloid-1

levels of acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of alcohol, refrain their carriers from drinking alcohol but may also put them at increased risk of cancer because of the mutagenic and carcinogenic effect of acetaldehyde. In a population-based study of 305 cases and 428 controls in Warsaw, Poland, we evaluated the effect of polymorphisms in alcohol metabolizing genes, including ADH1B (Ex9+5C>T, Ex3+23A>G, Ex3+58A>T and Ex9+77A>G), ADH1C (Ex8-56A>G and Ex6-14G>A) and ALDH2 (Ex1+82A>G), on levels of alcohol drinking and susceptibility of stomach cancer. We found that among control subjects frequency of alcohol drinking varied by alcohol metabolizing genotype. In particular, the weekly consumption of individuals carrying the AA, GA and GG genotypes of ALDH2 Ex1+82A>G polymorphism were 3.75, 2.26 and 1.53 drinks, respectively (p=0.04). However, none of the assessed polymorphisms in these 3 genes had a measurable effect on stomach cancer risk. When stratified by ALDH2 Ex1+82A>G polymorphism, alcohol-related increases in stomach cancer risk were restricted to individuals with the AG/GG genotypes, with a more than 2-fold risk among daily drinkers (OR=2.63, 95% CI=1.00-6.88) and 3-fold risk (OR=3.66, 95% CI=1.19-11.24) among those with 40 or more drink-years. In summary, our results suggested that the ALDH2 Ex1+82 G allele may be functionally deficient in eliminating acetaldehyde and discourage alcohol drinking. Furthermore, heavy drinkers of alcohol who were genetically prone to accumulate acetaldehyde may face an increased risk of stomach cancer.CI - Copyright (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss,

to modern adjuvant treatment is in part due to the failure of programmed cell death. Therefore the molecules that execute the apoptotic program are potential targets for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics. The sigma-2 receptor has been found to be over-expressed in some types of malignant tumors, and, recently, small molecule ligands to the sigma-2 receptor were found to induce cancer cell apoptosis. RESULTS: The sigma-2 receptor was expressed at high levels in both human and murine pancreas cancer cell lines, with minimal or limited expression in normal tissues, including: brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and spleen. Micro-PET imaging was used to demonstrate that the sigma-2 receptor was preferentially expressed in tumor as opposed to normal tissues in pancreas tumor allograft-bearing mice. Two structurally distinct sigma-2 receptor ligands, SV119 and WC26, were found to induce apoptosis to mice and human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Sigma-2 receptor ligands induced apoptosis in a dose dependent fashion in all pancreatic cell lines tested. At the highest dose tested (10 muM), all sigma-2 receptor ligands induced 10-20% apoptosis in all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested (p < 0.05). In pancreas tumor allograft-bearing mice, a single bolus dose of WC26 caused approximately 50% apoptosis in the tumor compared to no appreciable apoptosis in tumor-bearing, vehicle-injected control animals (p < 0.0001). WC26 significantly slowed tumor growth after a 5 day treatment compared to vehicle-injected control animals (p < 0.0001) and blood chemistry panels suggested that there is minimal peripheral toxicity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a novel therapeutic strategy that induces a significant increase in pancreas cancer cell death.

We have done an exploratory, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial to investigate the tissue-specific effects of 2.5 mg tibolone on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, in particular on tissue proliferation (STEM, Study of Tibolone Effects on Mamma carcinoma tissue). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Postmenopausal women with initially stage I/II, estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) primary breast cancer, were randomly assigned to 14 days of placebo or 2.5 mg/d tibolone. Core biopsies of the primary tumor were obtained before and after treatment. Ki-67 and apoptosis index were analyzed in baseline and corresponding posttreatment specimen. RESULTS: Of 102 enrolled patients, 95 had evaluable data. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both treatment groups. Breast cancer cases are mainly invasive (99%), stage I or II (42% and 50% respectively), and ER+ (99%). Median intratumoral Ki-67 expression at baseline was 13.0% in the tibolone group and 17.8% in the placebo group, and decreased to 12.0% after 14 days of tibolone while increasing to 19.0% in the placebo group. This change from baseline was not significantly different between tibolone and placebo (Wilcoxon test; P=0.17). A significant difference was observed between the treatment groups when the median change from baseline apoptosis index was compared between the treatment groups (tibolone, 0.0%; placebo, +0.3%; Wilcoxon test; P=0.031).

Moderate to severe interface hepatitis and cholangiolitis were present. There was a striking acinar mixed inflammatory infiltrate made up of polymorphs, lymphocytes and macrophages; frequent apoptotic hepatocytes, focal necrosis, cholestatic rosettes and zone 3 canalicular and cytoplasmic bilirubinostasis were noted. Significant steatosis, megamitochondria and Mallory bodies were not present. There was no evidence of iron, copper or alpha(1)-antitrypsin accumulation.

This particular resistance mechanism may be circumvented by platinum complexes that bind differently to DNA. One line of work is focussed on trans platinum complexes, some of which exhibit antitumour activity similar to or even higher than that of their cis counterparts. METHODS: We synthesised new trans platinum complexes, trans-[PtCl2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)] and trans-[PtCl2(OH)2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)], previously evaluated as cytotoxic agents towards different cancer and normal cell lines. These trans platinum compounds were highly effective against a panel of tumoral cell lines either sensitive to or with acquired resistance to cisplatin. RESULTS: In the present work we examined the mechanisms induced by these compounds to cause tumour cells toxicity. We have found that these compounds induced a complete blockade at the S phase of the cell cycle inhibiting total mRNA transcription and precluding p53 activation. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other DNA-damaging agents, these compounds do not induce senescence-associated permanent arrest. Furthermore, only a small percentage of these cells enter into apoptosis, with most of the population dying by a necrosis-like mechanism."],"offsets":[[154,1490]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4505","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["Trans-platinum(II)"],"offsets":[[0,18]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4506","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["cyclohexylamine"],"offsets":[[34,49]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4507","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["expectator ligand"],"offsets":[[53,70]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4508","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["necrosis"],"offsets":[[78,86]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4509","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["tumour"],"offsets":[[90,96]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4510","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["cisplatin"],"offsets":[[186,195]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4511","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["cisplatin"],"offsets":[[270,279]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4512","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["platinum complexes"],"offsets":[[341,359]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4513","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["trans platinum complexes"],"offsets":[[422,446]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4514","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["trans platinum complexes"],"offsets":[[581,605]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4515","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["trans-[PtCl2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)]"],"offsets":[[607,652]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4516","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["trans-[PtCl2(OH)2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)]"],"offsets":[[657,707]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4517","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["cytotoxic agents"],"offsets":[[733,749]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4518","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[768,774]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4519","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["trans platinum compounds"],"offsets":[[804,828]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4520","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["tumoral cell lines"],"offsets":[[870,888]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4521","type":"Chemicals & Drugs","text":["cisplatin"],"offsets":[[940,949]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4522","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["tumour"],"offsets":[[1043,1049]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4523","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["DNA-damaging"],"offsets":[[1262,1274]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4524","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["necrosis"],"offsets":[[1466,1474]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4525","type":"","text":["cisplatin"],"offsets":[[940,949]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4526","type":"","text":["tumoral cell lines"],"offsets":[[870,888]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4528","type":"","text":["trans platinum compounds"],"offsets":[[804,828]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4529","type":"","text":["tumoral cell lines"],"offsets":[[870,888]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4531","type":"","text":["Trans-platinum(II)"],"offsets":[[0,18]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4532","type":"","text":["tumour"],"offsets":[[90,96]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4534","type":"","text":["expectator ligand"],"offsets":[[53,70]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4535","type":"","text":["tumour"],"offsets":[[90,96]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4537","type":"","text":["trans platinum complexes"],"offsets":[[581,605]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4538","type":"","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[768,774]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4540","type":"","text":["trans-[PtCl2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)]"],"offsets":[[607,652]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4541","type":"","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[768,774]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4543","type":"","text":["trans-[PtCl2(OH)2(cyclohexylamine)(dimethylamine)]"],"offsets":[[657,707]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4544","type":"","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[768,774]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4546","type":"","text":["cytotoxic agents"],"offsets":[[733,749]],"normalized":[]},{"id":"4547","type":"","text":["cancer"],"offsets":[[768,774]],"normalized":[]}],"events":[],"coreferences":[],"relations":[{"id":"4527","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4525","arg2_id":"4526","normalized":[]},{"id":"4530","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4528","arg2_id":"4529","normalized":[]},{"id":"4533","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4531","arg2_id":"4532","normalized":[]},{"id":"4536","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4534","arg2_id":"4535","normalized":[]},{"id":"4539","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4537","arg2_id":"4538","normalized":[]},{"id":"4542","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4540","arg2_id":"4541","normalized":[]},{"id":"4545","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4543","arg2_id":"4544","normalized":[]},{"id":"4548","type":"PA","arg1_id":"4546","arg2_id":"4547","normalized":[]}]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":82,"row":{"id":"4550","document_id":"4550","passages":[{"id":"4551","type":"title","text":["Stomal varices: a rare cause of stomal hemorrhage.

The response to BMP is determined by intracellular proteins interacting with the signal mediators Smads 1 and 5.

It interacted with Smads 1 and 5 and overexpression led to an attenuation of BMP-dependent transcription. Calponin 3 mRNA and protein were expressed in cartilage tissue and isolated chondrocytes and a slight, but statistically significant reduction of mRNA expression levels could be detected in osteoarthritic cartilage. Our results suggest a role of calponin 3 in the regulation of BMP-dependent cellular responses. By interaction with the Smad proteins 1 and 5 and the inhibition of BMP-induced transcription, calponin 3 provides a negative regulatory mechanism for the BMP signaling pathway. This inhibitory effect likely depends on a sequestration of the Smads to the cytoskeleton due to the actin-binding properties of calponin 3.

overexpressed at sites of vascular pathology. A soluble RAGE isoform (sRAGE) neutralizes the ligand-mediated damage by acting as a decoy. We hypothesized that in hypercholesterolemia up-regulation of the ligand-RAGE axis may bridge impairment of nitric oxide biosynthesis with oxidative stress. We measured in 60 hypercholesterolemic patients and 20 controls plasma total sRAGE levels, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) excretion, and plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The effects of two structurally different statins (pravastatin and atorvastatin) on these parameters were analyzed in 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects free of vascular disease. Plasma sRAGE was significantly lower, ADMA and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) were higher, in hypercholesterolemic versus normocholesterolemic patients. Patients on statin treatment with previous myocardial infarction had lower 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), higher sRAGE, and unchanged ADMA levels compared to subjects free of vascular disease. On multivariate regression analysis only 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and ADMA predicted sRAGE levels. An 8-week treatment with either statin was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), whereas only atorvastatin raised sRAGE levels near to normal values, with no change in ADMA levels. sRAGE might serve as an endogenous protecting factor for accelerated atherosclerosis mediated by oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in

Exposure to Benzodiazepines (BZD) during foetal life has been suggested to contribute to neonatal morbidity and some congenital malformations, for example, orofacial clefts. Here we aimed to study the neonatal outcome and congenital malformations in neonates whose mothers reported use of BZD and/or hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists (HBRA) during pregnancy. METHODS: In the Swedish Medical Birth Register we identified 1979 infants whose mothers (n = 1944) reported use of BZD and/or HBRA in early pregnancy. An additional 401 infants were studied, born to 390 mothers who were prescribed such drugs during late pregnancy. Neonatal outcome including congenital malformations after exposure was compared with that of all births (n = 873 879). RESULTS: An increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight was detected in the exposed population. The rate of relatively major congenital malformations was moderately increased among infants exposed in early pregnancy (adjusted OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.00-1.55), not explained by known teratogenic maternal co-medication. A higher than expected number of infants with pylorostenosis or alimentary tract atresia (especially small gut) was found. This was, however, based on only seven infants for each group of malformation without association to any specific BZD or HBRA. The earlier proposed increased risk for orofacial clefts was not confirmed in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal use of BZD and/or HBRA may increase the risk for preterm birth and low birth weight and cause neonatal symptoms, but does not appear to have a strong teratogenic potential. The tentative association with pylorostenosis and alimentary tract atresia needs confirmation."],"offsets":[[125,1840]]}],"entities":[{"id":"4957","type":"Chemicals &

The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) compartmentalize the signaling proteins necessary for odor detection; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms of protein sorting/entry into olfactory cilia. Nephrocystins are a family of ciliary proteins likely involved in cargo sorting during transport from the basal body to the ciliary axoneme. In humans, loss-of-function of the cilia-centrosomal protein CEP290/NPHP6 is associated with Joubert and Meckel syndromes, whereas hypomorphic mutations result in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a form of early-onset retinal dystrophy. Here, we report that CEP290-LCA patients exhibit severely abnormal olfactory function. In a mouse model with hypomorphic mutations in CEP290 [retinal dystrophy-16 mice (rd16)], electro-olfactogram recordings revealed an anosmic phenotype analogous to that of CEP290-LCA patients. Despite the loss of olfactory function, cilia of OSNs remained intact in the rd16 mice. As in wild type, CEP290 localized to dendritic knobs of rd16 OSNs, where it was in complex with ciliary transport proteins and the olfactory G proteins G(olf) and Ggamma(13). Interestingly, we observed defective ciliary localization of G(olf) and Ggamma(13) but not of G protein-coupled odorant receptors or other components of the odorant signaling pathway in the rd16 OSNs. Our data implicate distinct mechanisms for ciliary transport of olfactory signaling proteins, with CEP290 being a key mediator involved in G protein trafficking.

rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an inflammatory disorder of the sinonasal mucosa that is frequently associated with microbial colonization. Innate defense mechanisms at the mucosal surface are critical in protecting the host from airborne environmental pathogens. Recent studies of skin and gastrointestinal tract inflammatory diseases have shown that stimulation of the interleukin-22 receptor (IL-22R1) nonspecifically increases innate immune responses. The potential role of IL-22R1 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP has never been explored. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. METHODS: Nine controls and 19 subjects with CRS were prospectively enrolled prior to undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Nasal epithelial cells were cultured from surgically obtained ethmoid mucosa and IL-22R1 protein expression was examined via flow cytometry. RNA was extracted from whole mucosal samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine expression of IL22 and IL-22R1. Subjects were followed for at least 6 months postoperative to assess for recurrence or persistence of polyps. RESULTS: Flow cytometry demonstrated the expression of IL-22R1 protein on the surface of cultured nasal epithelial cells. IL-22R1 mRNA was expressed in 100% of the controls and CRSsNP. However, IL-22R1 was only expressed in 55% of patients with recalcitrant CRSwNP. Additionally, levels of IL22R1 were significantly lower in recalcitrant CRSwNP compared to controls and CRSsNP. IL22 levels did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate IL-22R1 mRNA and protein expression on nasal epithelial cells. Failure of medical and surgical therapy in CRSwNP is associated with significantly decreased expression of IL-22R1. Further research is needed to determine the potential of IL-22R1 as a therapeutic target in CRSwNP."],"offsets":[[117,1993]]}],"entities":[{"id":"5232","type":"Diseases & Disorders","text":["Chronic

The mechanisms underlying this modulation remain ill defined. The dopamine transporter, which terminates dopamine transmission via reuptake of released neurotransmitter, is regulated by receptor- and second messenger-linked signaling pathways. Whether D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function is unknown. We addressed this issue using a fluorescent imaging technique that permits real time quantification of dopamine transporter function in living single cells. Accumulation of the fluorescent dopamine transporter substrate trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)) in human embryonic kidney cells expressing human dopamine transporter was saturable and temperature-dependent. In cells co-expressing dopamine transporter and D3 receptors, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole produced a rapid, concentration-dependent, and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase of ASP(+) uptake. Similar agonist effects were observed in Neuro2A cells and replicated in human embryonic kidney cells using a radioligand uptake assay in which binding to and activation of D3 receptors by [(3)H]dopamine was prevented. D3 receptor stimulation activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK. Inhibition of either kinase prevented the quinpirole-induced increase in uptake. D3 receptor activation differentially affected dopamine transporter function and subcellular distribution depending on the duration of agonist exposure. Biotinylation experiments revealed that the rapid increase of uptake was associated with increased cell surface and decreased intracellular expression and increased dopamine transporter exocytosis. In contrast, prolonged agonist exposure reduced uptake and transporter cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function and identify a novel mechanism by which D3 receptors regulate extracellular dopamine

OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine recent time trends in the prevalence of anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria by describing trends and age and sex differentials in hospitalizations for these conditions in Australia. METHODS: Data on hospital admissions and deaths for anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria were extracted for the periods 1993-1994 to 2004-2005 and 1997-2004, respectively. For hospital admissions, age-standardized rates were calculated. Time trends and sex differences were quantified by using negative binomial models. RESULTS: During the study period, there was a continuous increase in the rate of hospital admissions for angioedema (3.0% per year), urticaria (5.7% per year), and, most notably, anaphylaxis (8.8% per year). There was a particularly steep increase in the incidence of hospitalization for food-related anaphylaxis among children aged less than 5 years. Admissions for non-food-related anaphylaxis occurred predominantly in adults, particularly those more than 35 years of age. Among children, admission rates were higher in boys, but the sex difference was reversed among adults. Over an 8-year period, there were 106 deaths associated with anaphylaxis or angioedema. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates for allergic conditions are on the increase, but the nature and causative factors differ between adults and children.

DESIGN: Extrusion assays using flow cytometry analysis were used to determine the ability of thyroid cancer cells to extrude the chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin, via the ABCG2 drug transporter in the presence or absence of gefitinib. Immunofluorescence was employed to determine the cellular expression of ABCG2. The ABCG2 expression in ARO and WRO cell lines was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Inactivation of EGFR kinase by gefitinib was analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay was performed to demonstrate ABCG2-mediated apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin. Colony formation assays were performed to determine the effect of gefitinib on thyroid cancer cell survival in response to gefitinib, doxorubicin, or the combination of both drugs. RESULTS: Inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by gefitinib causes the translocation of the ABCG2 drug transporter away from the plasma membrane, resulting in a concomitant decrease in doxorubicin extrusion in thyroid cancer cell lines. Both ARO and WRO demonstrated differential ABCG2 expression, whereas both were sensitized to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis on ABCG2 knockdown with short interfering RNA. The addition of gefitinib increases doxorubicin-induced cell death in thyroid cancer cells as measured by colony formation assay. CONCLUSIONS: Epidermal growth factor receptor regulates the function of the drug transporter ABCG2/BCRP1 and correlates with ABCG2 protein expression levels. Inactivation of the EGFR kinase by gefitinib potentiates the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in thyroid cancer, most likely by decreasing the ability of the cell to extrude doxorubicin. The expression of ABCG2 may explain in part the ineffectiveness of doxorubicin as a single modality treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer or for treatment of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer. Use of this combination treatment of gefitinib and doxorubicin may be a promising therapy for anaplastic thyroid and metastatic follicular thyroid cancer and needs to be investigated
